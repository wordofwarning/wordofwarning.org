**Social Experiment** is a new gathering at <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> for anyone interested in Live Art and contemporary performance to meet, chat, and try ideas out…         
          
A free and informal, semi-regular evening event — the first is on **Thursday 6 February** with future events on **22 May**, **17 July**, and **27 November 2025**.         
         
If you're a Greater Manchester artist — this is your chance to test out a short performance, intervention, or durational work, in front of an informal audience.
