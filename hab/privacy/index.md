##### Information collection        
We collect various types of information and in a number of ways:<br>**Information you give us** — for example, when you complete an online application form, or fill in an artist evaluation form, we’ll store personal information you give us such as your name, email address, post code, telephone number.<br>**Information about your interactions with us** — for example, when you visit our website we collect information about how you interact with our content, or when we send you an email we store a record of this.<br>**Information from third parties** — we occasionally receive information about you from third parties.
