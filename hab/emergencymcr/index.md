<small>Updated 16 Nov 2022</small>        
        
[hÅb](/hab) maintains the **emergencymcr googlegroup** for artists working in Live Art, contemporary performance, and dance across Greater Manchester + Northern England.         
         
Formerly known as the EmergencyNW e-group (hosted at yahoo), current members include almost everyone who has performed at one of our platform events, with ~360 members as of February 2020.        
           
We forward information and artist opportunities to this group, both our own projects + information we think may be useful, and members can post messages, call-outs, etc.       
         
To join the group please email Tamsin Drury (hÅb's Director) via <mailto:info@habmcr.org> — please tell us a little bit about yourself so we can keep the group friendly + relevant.
