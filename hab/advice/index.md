Please see our [News page](/news/#artists) for latest advice and support information for artists, creatives, and freelancers.         

Following on from the GM Artist Hub advisory sessions (2020-23), [hÅb](/hab) is now offering FREE 30-minute advice sessions with Tamsin Drury via Zoom on Mondays (excluding Bank Holidays).

[hÅb](/hab)'s specialism is Live Art and contemporary performance, though all-comers welcome. If you're an artist wanting to discuss creative ideas, funding, opportunities, or just need a chat, please book a session below.

For specific queries, please email 
         

Make a booking.
• Please note: if you book at the last minute we may not be able to accommodate you;
• Sessions take place privately in Zoom (or you can opt for a phone call in access requirements when booking);
• You can choose to attend a Zoom meeting without signing up for a Zoom account, meaning you won’t need to provide your personal data;
• You can opt to “stop video” or enable a “virtual backdrop” before your session starts if you prefer as a safeguarding option.
