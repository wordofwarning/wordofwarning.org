Please see our [News page](/news/#artists) for latest advice and support information for artists, creatives, and freelancers.         

If you’re an artist, theatre-maker, freelancer, creative, company, or producer based in Greater Manchester — we’d like to talk to you.

Maybe you want to discuss your creative ideas,  or get some advice on issues that are causing you concern,  or simply develop your network & stay connected…

We currently offer FREE 30-minute advisory sessions via Zoom (or phone call) on Mondays (excluding Bank Holidays).

You’re welcome to book more than one session, though please leave space for others by spreading your bookings out over several weeks.

Please book in with us below for a chat — bring your own brew!

For specific queries about sessions, please email 
         
Who you’ll meet & when.
Our producers bring together a wide range of expertise — meet someone with a particular specialism or book in for a general advice session to talk about anything you like; find more about us here.

Make a booking.
• Please note: if you book at the last minute we may not be able to accommodate you;
• Sessions take place privately in Zoom (or you can opt for a phone call in access requirements when booking);
• You can choose to attend a Zoom meeting without signing up for a Zoom account, meaning you won’t need to provide your personal data;
• You can opt to “stop video” or enable a “virtual backdrop” before your session starts if you prefer as a safeguarding option.
