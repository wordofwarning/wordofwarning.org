**Works Ahead** is a project developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes hÅb ran with greenroom until 2011. Since 2012 it has offered thirty-five small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the previous year's [Emergency](/hab/emergency) platform and/or other events; support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work, in partnership with <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>…

#### 2012         
The [first Works Ahead](/archive/2012-woah) was a new partnership at Contact (as a Re:Con co-production), featuring a night of performances in May from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans + Krissi Musiol, and an evening of interactions in June from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley + Small Acts… See [images](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
#### 2013                 
Our [second Works Ahead](/archive/2013-worksahead) took place at Contact in May, with a night of work that moved you from 70/30 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau + Ellen Turner (*winner of the 2012 [Turn](/hab/turn) Prize*), and a night of work that spoke to you from Lena Simic, Façade Theatre + Wayne Steven Jackson… See [images](/galleries/2013-woah).        
       
#### 2014

#### 2015         
Our [fourth Works Ahead](/archive/2015-worksahead) took place at Contact in April, with a double bill from two young male artists questioning manliness in this digitised, disembodied, discombobulated era: Nathan Birkinshaw + Jamil Keating… See [images](/galleries/2015-woah).          
           
#### 2016

#### 2018

#### 2019

#### 2020         
Our ninth Works Ahead was planned as a sited double bill at NIAMOS in May from artists Will Dickie and Ross McCaffrey — [Will](/archive/2020-spring/dickie) adapted his work for livestreaming and <a href="http://youtu.be/yrZFSzURaS4" target="_blank">broadcast in May</a>; Ross postponed sharing his work until it could be shown to a physical audience, now happening in [2022](/hab/worksahead/#2022).         
            
#### 2021         
In partnership with Contact, commissions were awarded to artists Helena Ascough and Jade Williams for them to develop ideas for presentation in the future…       
         
#### 2022         
Our tenth Works Ahead takes place at the brand new <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> in May — picking up where we were interrupted in [2020](/hab/worksahead/#2020) to show Will Dickie's finished live work alongside Ross McCaffrey's re-imagined development and Helena Ascough's digital outcome from [2021]. Jade William's work will come to fruition in 2023.
