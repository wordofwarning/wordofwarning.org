#### 2012         
The [first Works Ahead](/archive/2012-woah) was a new partnership at Contact (as a Re:Con co-production), featuring a night of performances in May from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans + Krissi Musiol, and an evening of interactions in June from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley + Small Acts… See [images](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
#### 2013

Our ninth Works Ahead was planned as a sited double bill at NIAMOS in May from artists Will Dickie and Ross McCaffrey — [Will](/archive/2020-spring/dickie) adapted his work for livestreaming, which was <a href="http://youtu.be/yrZFSzURaS4" target="_blank">broadcast in May</a>; Ross postponed sharing his work until it could be shown to a physical audience, which will happen in [2022](/hab/worksahead/#2022).
