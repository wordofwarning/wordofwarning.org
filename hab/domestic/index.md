**[2020](/archive/2020-domestic)/[21](/current/2021-domestic)'s series of Domestic "at homes"** are an informal online platform for artists to beta test new work, live from their homes… What can you make when your kitchen table, bathroom, or garden tent is the stage — and your camera is the audience?        
<hr>         
We're interested in what artists want to say right now — our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">**rolling open call for proposals**</a> seeks short (max 10 mins) live art and/or contemporary performance works that can be presented online, within an artist's available resources — *for the next event in early May, we're accepting proposals until 9 April 2021.*         
         
**[July 2020](/archive/2020-domestic/july)**'s pilot featured 6 invited artists (<a href="http://youtu.be/IUNv7CARKLU" target="_blank">watch livestream archive</a>); **[August](/archive/2020-domestic/august)** featured 7 works selected from our open call (<a href="http://youtu.be/AOT29ZTtZAA" target="_blank">livestream</a>); **[October](/archive/2020-domestic/october)** featured 8 works (<a href="http://youtu.be/seg57Z8-mfk" target="_blank">livestream</a>); **[January 2021](/current/2021-domestic/january)** featured 7 works (<a href="http://youtu.be/VsDRVALM2Ao" target="_blank">livestream</a>); and **[March](/current/2021-domestic/march)**'s event featured 5 works (livestream available soon) — all hosted by Peader Kirk.        
         
Alongside live works, artists propose pre-recorded pieces that don't fit this format — so in December 2020 we introduced **<a href="http://domesticatedonline.org" target="_blank">Domesticated</a>**, a new home for video performance whose first guests are Beth Clayton, Freddie Watkins, Heather Bandenburg, Kellie Colbert & Deborah Newton, Mahboobeh Rajabi, Nicholas Tee, Oliver Ford, Sandra Bouguerch.

#### *Domestic origins…*         
In 2013/15/17 we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…         
         
**November 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including Alex Bradley, Fergus J Evans, Greg Wohead, Jo Bannon, Leentje Van de Cruys + the vacuum cleaner… Work ranged from an immersive environment in a garage to a solo naked shower piece + a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes… See the [image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).         
         
**In September 2015, [Domestic II](/archive/2015-domestic)** was unleashed on a new block of flats, this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment — Matthias Court (M3 6JD) was a space in transition — using only the top (15th) + ground floors over 3 nights + a day to show 17 pieces by artists including Afreena Islam, Catherine Hoffman, Cheryl Martin, Leo Burtin, Louise Wallwein, Michael Pinchbeck + Ria Hartley… See a rapid overview <a href="http://vimeo.com/143630694" target="_blank">on vimeo</a> + the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-domestic).        
        
**In November 2017, [*Rent Party: Domestic Edition*](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard)** popped up next door in Salford's Adelphi Court during its refurb… Part show, part party, Darren Pritchard Dance's joyously defiant stand against growing up poor is a 21st century, austerity Britain, black, gay, immersive musical — for those just about managing. See the [image gallery](/galleries/2017-domestic). Thanks to our generous audiences we donated £574.65 & four crates of food to Salford Foodbank.
