**Divergency** is a group of artists as diverse as their subject matter… meeting… talking… eating… exploring…          
        
Established in 2014 in response to a Creative Case North residency investigating under-representation in Live Art, Divergency is an ongoing artist development programme encouraging diversity in Live Art — supported by [hÅb](/hab) and using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England. *From 2014 to 2021* Sustained Theatre Up North (STUN) was a Divergency partner.
