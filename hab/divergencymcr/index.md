**Divergency** is a group of artists as diverse as their subject matter… meeting… talking… eating… exploring…          
        
Established in 2014 in response to a Creative Case North residency investigating under-representation in live art, Divergency is an ongoing artist development programme encouraging diversity in live art — supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, and by [hÅb](/hab) + <a href='http://stunlive.com' target='_blank'>STUN</a> (Sustained Theatre Up North).
