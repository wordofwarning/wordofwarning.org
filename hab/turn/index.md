***Currently on hiatus*, Turn** is our annual platform for North West† dancers + dance-makers. Formerly held in Manchester each spring, the last edition in 2017 had a new format with a dozen short pieces of new work shown to the public on a Friday night, followed by a Saturday of professional development…        
         
Our [**ninth Turn**](/archive/2017-turn) took place at Contact on **Friday 28 April 2017**, with a dozen new northern dance-works — to get a feel for it see the [image gallery](/galleries/2017-turn), or delve further with 2016's [gallery](/galleries/2016-turn) + [programme](/archive/2015-turn) and 2015's [gallery](/galleries/2015-turn) + [programme](/archive/2015-turn).
