**Turn** is our annual platform for North West† dancers and dance-makers — an opportunity to engage with new dance in Manchester each spring. After a 6-year hiatus it returns to <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> in **March 2023** — get a feel for it with 2017's [programme](/archive/2017-turn/programme) + [image gallery](/galleries/2017-turn).         
        
Manchester's open call dance platform, Turn aims to be:<br>— a public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work;<br>— an artist networking event.
