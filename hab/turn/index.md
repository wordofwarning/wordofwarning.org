<small>Updated 29 January 2024</small>        
        
**Turn** is our annual platform for North West† dancers and dance-makers — an opportunity to engage with new dance in Greater Manchester each spring.    
             
The eleventh edition takes place in **March 2024** at new home <a href="https://companychameleon.com" target="_blank">Company Chameleon</a> Studios, and this time things will be a little different as we plan to use just the one studio on Friday 22 March… and *possibly* Friday 15 March.        
         
Get a feel for it with 2023's [programme notes](/current/2023-turn/programme) and [gallery of images](/galleries/2023-turn).
