<small>Updated 7 May 2024</small>        
        
**Turn** is our annual platform for North West† dancers and dance-makers — an opportunity to engage with new dance in Greater Manchester each spring.    
             
The eleventh edition, [Turn 2024](/current/2024-turn) took place at new home <a href="https://companychameleon.com" target="_blank">Company Chameleon</a> Studios, and this time things were a little different as we used just the one studio to show eight short dance-works on **Friday 22 March, 7.30pm**.        
         
Read [2024's programme notes](/current/2024-turn/programme) and look at [images from the event](/galleries/2024-turn).         
        
Greater Manchester's open call dance platform, Turn aims to be:<br>— a public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work;<br>— an artist networking event;<br>— a selection event for the Turn Prize commission (*see below*).
