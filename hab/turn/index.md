**Turn** is our annual platform for North West† dancers and dance-makers — an opportunity to engage with new dance in Manchester. After a 6-year hiatus it returned to <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on [**10 March 2023**](/current/2023-turn) for a tenth edition with nine short works — get a feel for it with our gallery of [artist's images](/galleries/2023-turnpre) and read their [programme notes](/current/2023-turn/programme).         
        
Manchester's open call dance platform, Turn aims to be:<br>— a public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work;<br>— an artist networking event.         
        
#### Turn 2023 Call for Proposals has closed       
North West† dancers and dance-makers (*aged 18+*) <a href="https://turnmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">were invited to submit proposals</a> for inclusion in this event by 13 January; see selected artists [here](/current/2023-turn/#artists).        
        
We experimented with the form of Turn this year, to include a single **evening of public performances on Fri 10 March** — followed by an **artist day on Sat 11 March** incorporating a workshop or masterclasses and feedback sessions. Participating artists are expected to attend **both** days.        
         
† *<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England" target="_blank">North West England</a> consists of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire + Merseyside; it does **NOT** include Yorkshire or Derbyshire*.
