### Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
<small>Updated 4 July 2023</small>        
        
hÅb is a Manchester-based producer, developer, and strategic advocate of Live Art, contemporary performance, and sited work in the North of England.        
        
<a href="http://greenroomarts.org" target="_blank">greenroom</a>'s key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy — working in collaboration with a range of [partners](/hab/partners) to produce showing opportunities, platforms, and artist development projects including: [Divergency](/hab/divergencymcr), [Domestic](/hab/domestic), [Emergency](/hab/emergency), [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), [Turn](/hab/turn), and [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead).         
          
Essentially industry-facing, we work with [artists, colleagues, venues, and others](/hab/partners) to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish. We also offer free 30-minute [Advice Sessions](/hab/advice) on Mondays with Tamsin Drury via Zoom.          
        
Supported using public funding by <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/how-we-invest-public-money/2023-26-Investment-Programme" target="_blank">Arts Council England</a>, hÅb is also:<br>**a** <a href="http://divergencymcr.org" target="_blank">Divergency</a> core partner — encouraging diversity in Live Art;<br>**a** <a href="http://manchesterindependents.org" target="_blank">Manchester Independents</a> lead partner — celebrating GM artists;<br>**a** <a href="http://liveartuk.org" target="_blank">Live Art UK</a> member — supporting & developing Live Art infrastructure;<br>**a** member of <a href="http://gm-artisthub.co.uk" target="_blank">GM Artist Hub</a> and the GM LGBTQ+ Arts & Culture Network.        
       
Since January 2012, hÅb has been 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/) — a peripatetic programme of, and online signpost to, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond… ***NB*** this part of our site aims to offer information to **artists** wishing to know more about hÅb's work and how to get involved; for information about our public-facing programme please see [Word of Warning](/).       
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), our annual micro-festival for new live work presenting up to 30 short works in a day each Autumn with <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>; through to [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work — we aim to provide a joined-up set of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in Live Art, contemporary performance, and sited work. Please see our [News page](/news/#artists) for latest information.             
         
In 2020 we began an online [Domestic](/hab/domestic) series, offering artists an opportunity to informally try out new ideas live from their homes — our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call seeks proposals</a> for performance works that can be presented online, within an artist's available resources. Alongside live works, artists proposed pre-recorded pieces — so in December 2020 we introduced <a href="http://domesticatedonline.org" target="_blank">Domesticated</a>, a home for video performance, featuring eight works.          
          
hÅb curates sited performance and interventions — presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention that takes performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre; as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our frequent foray into all ages Live Art with <a href="https://z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a>. We also present [Turn](/hab/turn) with <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, an annual micro-festival for new North West dance + dance-makers.           
         
In any given year, hÅb might work with 100 artists — and present a couple of platforms, a sited festival, and over 50 pieces of work as [Word of Warning](/).
