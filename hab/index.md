### Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
<small>Updated 8 January 2026</small>        
        
hÅb is a Manchester-based producer, developer, and strategic advocate of Live Art, contemporary performance, and sited work in the North of England.        
        
<a href="http://greenroomarts.org" target="_blank">greenroom</a>'s key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy — working in collaboration with a range of [partners](/hab/partners) to produce showing opportunities, platforms, and artist development projects including [Divergency](/hab/divergencymcr), [Emergency](/hab/emergency), [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), [Social Experiment](/hab/socialexperiment), [Turn](/hab/turn), and [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead).         
          
Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with [artists, peers, venues, and others](/hab/partners) to create the best possible [opportunities](/news/#artists) for new work to flourish. We also offer free 30-minute [Advice Sessions](/hab/advice) on Mondays with Tamsin Drury via Zoom.          
        
hÅb is supported using public funding by <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/NationalPortfolio23" target="_blank">Arts Council England (a National Portfolio Organisation)</a>. hÅb is also a <a href="http://divergencymcr.org" target="_blank">Divergency</a> core partner (encouraging diversity in Live Art); a <a href="https://manchesterindependents.org" target="_blank">Manchester Independents</a> lead partner (highlighting independent Greater Manchester artists); and a member of <a href="https://danceconsortianorthwest.org" target="_blank">Dance Consortia North West</a>, <a href="https://g-mast.org" target="_blank">GMAST</a>, the <a href="https://lgbt.foundation/connecting-communities" target="_blank">GM LGBTQ+ Arts and Culture Network</a>, and <a href="http://liveartuk.org" target="_blank">Live Art UK</a>.         
         
Since January 2012, hÅb has been 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/) — a peripatetic programme of, and online signpost to, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond… ***NB** this part of our site aims to offer **information to artists** wishing to know more about hÅb's work and how to get involved; for information on our public-facing programme please see [Word of Warning](/).*       
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), our annual micro-festival for new live work with <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, presenting about 25 short works in a day every autumn; through to [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work — hÅb aims to provide a joined-up set of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in Live Art, contemporary performance, and sited work.         
         
hÅb also started a new [Social Experiment](/hab/socialexperiment) with <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> in 2025: a semi-regular evening gathering for Live Art and contemporary performance, offering Greater Manchester artists a chance to test or try out ideas on a rolling basis…         
         
hÅb curates sited performance and interventions — presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention that takes performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre; as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our frequent foray into all ages Live Art with <a href="https://z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a>. We also present [Turn](/hab/turn), Greater Manchester's annual dance platform for new North West dance, every spring.          
         
In spring 2020 hÅb began an online [Domestic](/hab/domestic) series, offering artists an opportunity to informally try out new ideas live from their homes — our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call sought proposals</a> for performance works to be presented online, within an artist's available resources. Alongside live works, artists proposed pre-recorded pieces — so in December 2020 we introduced <a href="http://domesticatedonline.org" target="_blank">Domesticated</a>, a home for video performance, featuring eight works.          
         
In any given year, hÅb might work with 100 artists — and present a couple of platforms, a sited festival, and over 50 pieces of work as [Word of Warning](/).
