**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance, *usually* showing about 30 short works over a day/night in Manchester each Autumn — the upcoming 21st edition takes place in its seventh home, <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, and is necessarily a bit different…        
        
**[Emergency 21](/current/2021-emergency)** is a socially-distanced live walkthrough event at the brand new <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on **Saturday 25 September** — audiences will be guided on a one-way journey through the refurbished building, pausing en route in gallery fashion.        
        
Have a look at 2019's [programme](/archive/2019-emergency)/[gallery of images](/galleries/2019-emergency) and 2018's [programme](/archive/2018-emergency)/[gallery](/galleries/2018-emergency).         
        
*N.B. we <a href="http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">sought</a> approximately 10 works to fit these conditions: durational, performance installation, looping + intervention-based live works that can run over a minimum period of 4 hours. We realised it wouldn't be for everyone as the ask was constrained by circumstances — but we really thought we should give it a damn good go! Shifting regulations meant we postponed from [Nov 2020](/archive/2020-emergency) to Sep 2021*.

**Emergency StopGap** was a new iteration for 2020 — a small informal platform to bridge the gap between gallery + theatre, and to fill the empty months of winter… Taking place on [**27 February 2020**](/archive/2020-emergencystopgap) in Manchester's <a href="http://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a>, it was an informal 'Thursday Late' style evening featuring 13 durational live works + interventions in and around the building — see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2020-emergencystopgap).
