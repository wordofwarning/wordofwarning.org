<small>Updated 23 June 2022</small>        
        
**Emergency** is our annual platform for Live Art and contemporary performance, offering a sneak preview of new live work over a single day in Manchester every Autumn — now resident at <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, its seventh home.        
         
Manchester's [twenty-second micro-marathon](/current/2022-emergency) of the bizarre, the bold + the beautiful takes over the Contact building on **Saturday 1 October 2022** — with a daytime of performance installations, one-to-ones, and interventions, followed by an evening full of short shows…        
        
The call for artist's proposals is now open and we expect to present *about 20* short works throughout Contact — so if you would like to take part in what is *probably* England's longest running Live Art event, please read on…        
        
#### Emergency 22 Call-out       
Artists working in Live Art, contemporary performance, time-based media, and interdisciplinary arts are now invited to submit proposals; work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable.        
        
For full details and to apply please go to <a href="https://bit.ly/Emerg22" target="_blank">bit.ly/Emerg22</a>.<br>**Proposal Deadline: Friday 5 August, 5pm.**

#### Past Editions        
Get a feel for Emergency by having a look at [last year's 21st edition](/archive/2021-emergency), 2019's [programme](/archive/2019-emergency) + [gallery of images](/galleries/2019-emergency), and 2018's [programme](/archive/2018-emergency) + [gallery](/galleries/2018-emergency).         
        
**[Emergency 21](/archive/2021-emergency)** was a socially-distanced live walkthrough event at the newly re-opened <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on **25 September** — audiences were guided on a one-way journey through the refurbished building, pausing en route in gallery fashion.        
        
[**Emergency StopGap**](/archive/2020-emergencystopgap) was a new iteration for 2020 — a small informal platform to bridge the gap between gallery + theatre, and to fill the empty months of winter… Taking place on **27 February 2020** in Manchester's <a href="http://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a>, it was an informal 'Thursday Late' style evening featuring 13 durational live works + interventions in and around the building — to get a feel for it, please see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2020-emergencystopgap).
