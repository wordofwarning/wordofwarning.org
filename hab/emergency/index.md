**Emergency** is our annual platform for Live Art and contemporary performance — offering a sneak preview of new live work over a single day in Manchester every autumn and now resident at <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, its seventh home.        
         
Manchester's 24th micro-marathon of the bizarre, the bold, and the beautiful takes over <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on **Saturday 28 September 2024 (*tbc* Noon-10pm)**.

Manchester's annual Live Art & performance platform, Emergency aims to be:<br>— a free to access public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer review work;<br>— a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions.        
        
We usually expect to present *about* 20-25 short works throughout the building — so if you would like to take part in what is *probably* England's longest-running Live Art event, please check back for our next open call in June 2025.
