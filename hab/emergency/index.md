<small>Updated 20 June 2025</small>        
        
**Emergency** is our annual open call platform for Live Art and contemporary performance — offering a sneak preview of new live work over a single day in Manchester every autumn and now resident at <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, its seventh home.        
         
Manchester's 25th micro-marathon of the bizarre, the bold, and the beautiful takes over <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on **Saturday 27 September 2025, *tbc* from Noon to 10pm** — presenting *about 25* short works throughout the building.        
          
Get a feel for it with [2024's programme](/archive/2024-emergency/#artists) and [gallery of images](/galleries/2024-emergency); [2023's programme](/archive/2023-emergency/#artists) and [gallery](/galleries/2023-emergency); [2022's programme](/archive/2022-emergency/#artists) and [gallery](/galleries/2022-emergency).         
         
Manchester's annual Live Art & performance platform, Emergency aims to be:<br>— a free to access public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer review work;<br>— a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions.        
        
We usually expect to present *about 25* short works throughout the building — so if you would like to take part in what is *probably* England's longest-running Live Art event, please read on for our open call…

In addition to calling for new and emerging artists and work, we are interested in hearing from artists who have performed at Emergency over the past 25 years, and have any ideas to celebrate this milestone!
