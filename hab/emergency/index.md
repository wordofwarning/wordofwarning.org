**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance, *usually* showing about 30 short works over a day/night in Manchester each Autumn — last year's 21st edition took place in its seventh home, <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, and was necessarily a bit different; shifting regulations meant we postponed from [Nov 2020](/archive/2020-emergency) to [Sep 2021](/archive/2021-emergency)…              
        
**[Emergency 21](/archive/2021-emergency)** was a socially-distanced live walkthrough event at the brand new <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on **Saturday 25 September 2021** — audiences were guided on a one-way journey through the refurbished building, pausing en route in gallery fashion.<br>To get a feel of previous editions, please have a look at 2019's [programme](/archive/2019-emergency) + [gallery of images](/galleries/2019-emergency) or 2018's [programme](/archive/2018-emergency) + [gallery](/galleries/2018-emergency).

[**Emergency StopGap**](/archive/2020-emergencystopgap) was a new iteration for 2020 — a small informal platform to bridge the gap between gallery + theatre, and to fill the empty months of winter… Taking place on **27 February 2020** in Manchester's <a href="http://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a>, it was an informal 'Thursday Late' style evening featuring 13 durational live works + interventions in and around the building — to get a feel for it, please see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2020-emergencystopgap).
