**Emergency** is our annual platform for Live Art and contemporary performance — offering a sneak preview of new live work over a single day in Manchester every autumn and now resident at <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>, its seventh home.        
         
[Manchester's 23rd](/archive/2023-emergency) micro-marathon of the bizarre, the bold, and the beautiful took over <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> on **Saturday 30 September 2023** with 23 works.

Manchester's annual Live Art / performance platform, Emergency aims to be:<br>— a free to access public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer review work;<br>— a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions.        
        
We usually expect to present *about* 20-30 short works throughout the building — so if you would like to take part in what is *probably* England's longest-running Live Art event, please check back for our Open Call in summer 2024…
