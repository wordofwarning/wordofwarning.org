**Haphazard** is our frequent foray into 'all ages' Live Art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around and about Manchester's historic <a href="https://z-arts.org/about-us" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building.        
         
Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: this is Live Art for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!            
         
[Haphazard 2024](/current/2024-haphazard) is our seventh free 'all ages' Live Art takeover of <a href="https://z-arts.org/events/haphazard-2024" target="_blank">Z-arts</a>, on **Saturday 27 July, 1pm-4pm** — turn up at any time, come and go as you please… and expect the unexpected! Get a feel for it with [2023's programme](/archive/2023-haphazard/programme) and [gallery of images](/galleries/2023-haphazard).        
        
#### Haphazard 2024 Call for Proposals         
Artists are now <a href="https://haphazard.posthaven.com" target="_blank">invited to submit proposals</a> for inclusion in this event: this is not Live Art for children, but Live Art for ALL AGES — and we mean from tot to timeworn, 8 months to 80 years — so work should have appeal for adults and children alike (even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!)        
         
**Proposal Deadline: Friday 31 May 2024, 5pm**         
        
From experience, what works best are big surreal images, interesting repetitive movement, and nothing too text heavy. We have access to a number of spaces within Z-arts, and work immediately outside the building may also be possible. Durational, intervention, and 'come and go' work seems to work the best — we're not really looking for sit-down theatre shows.
