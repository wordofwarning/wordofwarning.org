**Haphazard** is our frequent foray into 'all ages' Live Art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around and about the historic <a href="https://z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: a free afternoon of Live Art for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!            

After a 4-year hiatus, [Haphazard 2023](/archive/2023-haphazard) was our sixth Live Art takeover of <a href="https://z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a>, with thirteen works on **Saturday 22 July 2023 from Noon to 3pm** — turn up at any time, come and go as you please… and expect the unexpected!

#### Past Editions
