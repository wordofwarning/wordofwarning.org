**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted in and around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids + their adults, adults + *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!            
           
Our **[fifth Haphazard](/archive/2019-haphazard)** took place on **Saturday 27 April 2019, 12noon-3pm**, with a bubbling symphony of a day — clouds of foam, a balloon-dance in reverse, a magical tree of fantasy creatures, and a game of high-flying paper; playful shadows, scarecrows with a conscience, a signing musical statue, and the hardest working moth in Tinseltown — now that it's over, see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2019-haphazard) from the day.        
          
Previous Haphazards have seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; a singing fish and a sax-playing bear; paintball golf and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet, and a tiny bee-shaped world… Get a feel for it with 2017's [gallery of images](/galleries/2017-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2017-haphazard), 2016's [gallery](/galleries/2016-haphazard)/[programme](/archive/2016-haphazard), 2015's [gallery](/galleries/2015-haphazard)/[programme](/archive/2015-haphazard), 2013's [gallery](/galleries//2013-haphazard)/[programme](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard).
