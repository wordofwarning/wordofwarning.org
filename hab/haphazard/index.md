**Haphazard** is our frequent foray into 'all ages' Live Art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around and about Hulme's historic <a href="https://z-arts.org/about-us" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building.        
         
Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: this is Live Art for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — anyone looking for a different day out!            

**Haphazard 2025** will be our eighth free Live Art takeover of <a href="https://www.z-arts.org/events/haphazard-2025" target="_blank">Z-arts</a>, presenting *about eight* works on **Saturday 2 August from 1pm to 4pm** — turn up at any time, come and go as you please… and expect the unexpected!        
         
Get a feel for it with [2024's programme](/archive/2024-haphazard/programme) and [gallery of images](/galleries/2024-haphazard) — also watch our <a href="https://youtu.be/sgw9SjPdCw0" target="_blank">short video</a> to see some of what's gone before.         
         
#### Haphazard 2025 Call for Proposals is Now Open        
Artists are <a href="https://haphazard.posthaven.com" target="_blank">now invited to submit proposals</a> for inclusion in this event:<br>this is not Live Art for children, but Live Art for ALL AGES — and we mean from tot to timeworn, 8 months to 80 years — so work should have appeal for adults and children alike (even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!)          
          
**If you'd like to hear more about what we think works for Haphazard have a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/2PncCQ7-YSs" target="_blank">recording of the Info Session we held on 16 April</a>.**        
          
From experience, what works best are big surreal images, interesting repetitive movement, and nothing too text heavy. We have access to a number of spaces within Z-arts, and work immediately outside the building may also be possible. Durational, intervention, and 'come and go' work seems to work the best — we're not really looking for sit-down theatre shows.
