**Hazard** is our biennial micro-festival of incidental intervention + sited performance, blurring the boundaries between art and activism…                    
              
Our **[seventh Hazard](/archive/2018-springsummer/hazardshadowgirl)** popped up in central Manchester on **4 August 2018**, with shadowy figures moving silently through the city streets, playing, questioning, exploring visibility + vulnerability… See [images](/galleries/2018-hazard) from the day.         
        
Since 2007 over 100 artists have taken to the streets of Manchester including: Action Hero, Alex Bradley, Instant Dissidence, Jordan Mackenzie, Juliann O'Malley, Katherina Radeva, Kris Canavan, Michael Pinchbeck, Nicola Hunter, Richard DeDomenici, Sexcentenary, Shahram Entekhabi, the vacuum cleaner — so far we've wrapped Cathedral Gardens in fluttering hazard tape, hosted the world's slowest fairground ride, moved the goalposts (literally) and witnessed breastfeeding in a shop window — oh, and conducted a hoola-hoopathon; The Larks have had the public riddling, racing and chasing as urban archaeologists and private investigators, injecting mass gaming into St Ann's Square and beyond.
