Please be aware that this is very much my pick, largely from paper — so don't hold it against me! Please forgive things I've missed and note I don't focus on internationals as they're beyond Word of Warning' programming paygrade! Final tips — please check dates carefully as you don't want to fall prey to random days off — and my main tip is to log-in to EdFringe, and use the favourites facility (you can then export them as a handy spreadsheet and sort it as you please — it's the only thing that keeps me halfway sane!) All that said I've not fully planned my strategy — it could well be an exhausting there and back for Live Art Bistro's overnight odyssey! *Hover over the PDF below, and right-click (or similar) to download/save to your own device.*
