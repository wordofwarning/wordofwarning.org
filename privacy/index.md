This policy explains:<br>• What information we may collect about you;<br>• How we may use that information;<br>• In what situations we may disclose your details to third parties;<br>• Our use of cookies to improve your use of our website;<br>• Information about how we keep your personal information secure, how long we maintain it for, and your rights to be able to access it.<br>If you have any queries about this policy, please contact the Data Protection Officer at hÅb <a href="mailto:info@habmcr.org?subject=Data Protection Enquiry">info@habmcr.org</a>.          
           
##### Information collection
We collect various types of information and in a number of ways:<br>**Information you give us** — for example, when you subscribe to our Weekly Warning online or in person, or fill in a post-show feedback form, or make a donation, or buy tickets from us, we’ll store personal information you give us such as your name, email address, post code, telephone number. We will also store a record of your donations.<br>**Information about your interactions with us** — for example, when you visit our website we collect information about how you interact with our content, or when we send you a Weekly Warning by email we store a record of this and keep a record of which ones you have opened and which links you have clicked on.<br>**Information from third parties** — we occasionally receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may use third party research companies to provide general information about you, compiled using publicly available data.<br>**Sensitive personal data** — Data Protection law recognises that certain categories of personal information are more sensitive such as health information, race, religious beliefs, and political opinions. We only collect this type of information when there is a clear reason for doing so, i.e. for monitoring equality of opportinuity when you complete a post-show feedback form, and this data is stored anonymously.            
            
##### Legal basis
There are three bases under which we may process your data:<br>**Contract purposes** — when you make a purchase from us or make a donation to us, you are entering into a contract with us. In order to perform this contract we need to process and store your data. For example we may need to contact you by email or telephone in the case of cancellation of a show, or in the case of problems with your payment.<br>**Legitimate business interests** — in certain situations we collect and process your personal data for purposes that are in our legitimate organisational interests; however, we only do this if there is no overriding prejudice to you by using your personal information in this way. We describe below all situations where we may use this basis for processing.<br>**With your explicit consent** — for any situations where the two bases above are not appropriate, we will instead ask for your explicit consent before using your personal information in that specific situation.            
            
##### Marketing communications

##### Other processing activities

You have the right to object to any of this processing at any time. If you wish to do this, please use the contact details at the end of this policy. Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out tasks above that are for your benefit.
