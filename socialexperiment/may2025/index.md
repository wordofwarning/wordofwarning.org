**Joely Mae Greally & Jasmine Naila Burt** · *Not Made To Last*         

Joely's practice is expansive, consulting mediums such as installation, sound, photography, moving image, printmaking, and performance as well as writing practices embodying fragmented and fictional romance rooted in truths. Her works attempt to be both fragmented, fabricated, natural, and erotic — and she uses opposition and polarity as a working tool.<br>Jasmine is a multidisciplinary visual and sound artist. Using her roots in playing bass guitar, exploring further into sonic landscapes using synthesisers, eclectic pop culture samples from the last century, and collected field recordings from day to day life. She's also a printmaker specialising in linoprinting, and enjoys seeing the links between creating layers of relief printing and creating layers of sound. Both visual and sonic mediums are intertwined and are an extension of each other.

**Lizzy Owen** · *[PAIN]ting*         
         
A visual and visceral interdisciplinary response to the turmoil of existing.<br>How can music and paint explore notions of how we view ourselves?<br>Can a conversation between these expose the realities that come with being in the world and our bodies out on display for judgement and perception?<br>And how does this affect our own view of ourselves and our physical being?<br>The body is on display for exposure and judgement.

**Secret Location Theatre Company** · *Fragile*         
          
An experimental work inspired by journal entries. Physically exploring sensitivity, Isobel asks: '*How do we fit into the world around us? How do we portray sensitivity to others? Am I too sensitive? Or is the world too cruel? Either way, how on earth do I cope?*'

**Paper People Theatre** · *The Opposite of Distance*         
         
*One night, a couple are attacked on the street, Sam appears to chase a mugger away, he returns to a devastated Molly cradling his bloodied corpse and realises he's dead… Oh wait — that's Ghost (1990). Well, one of us keeps dying. We've been apart for a while and things are feeling different. Come and see us try again after six years. Our bodies are different — it's taken a long time to grow together, like formations in a cave — we're here to re-emerge. How long does it take for stalagmites to form? I'm not sure we have that much time. One of us keeps dying. Please clap.*         
         
Paper People Theatre are an ensemble of three artists based in West Yorkshire, Manchester, London: Hannah Mook, Lowri Jones, Jake Walton. Their work is visually rich, vibrant, and always centered around human interactions and relationships. They explore these through movement, song, dance, text, and the interplay between themselves as performers and their fabricated landscape.

**Julie Burrow** · *An Evening With Me, Rosy Maple*         
         
Rosy Maple is the hardest-working moth in showbusiness.<br>Used to riding high as the only moth in Hollywood, Rosy's now on her uppers, touring smaller venues she's never heard of. She's determined to wow audiences with her stellar talent, cluelessly bringing Broadway-level energy to the stages of the North West with a big dose of silly, colourful fun.         

A Manchester-based writer-performer, Julie makes lo-fi, absurdist comedy. She's played an Aperol Spritz, a human tombola, and the entire city of Bruges. Julie's received multiple commissions to create short performances for Manchester cabaret and new writing nights, Word of Warning's Emergency and Haphazard, short filmed performances during lockdown, a new audio play, and twice been commissioned by Lowry. Also Resident Artist at Title Fight (monthly event at Grub produced by A Lovely Time), recently performed as a member of PISS SHY at Bonjour Claude's first experimental performance night at Levy Old Library, and regularly performs at Eryn Tett’s night GMIM (last time she channelled an alien).
