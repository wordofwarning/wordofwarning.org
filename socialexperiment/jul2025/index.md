**James Moss** · *Making Believe*          
         
Audio-visual series incorporating cut up, manipulated, and reassembled spoken word readings of books by Clara Barton, Virginia Woolf, Sigmund Freud, and Henrietta Marshall, plus texts from Xhi Ndubisi & Jo Manby's *Passing Cloud* series.<br>Collaged and edited archive film exploring authorship, obsolescence, and illusion in the information age.         
         
James makes artworks, performances, and exhibitions in collaboration with writers, researchers, residents, and visitors. Themes of particular interest include time, potential, work and waste; absence and erasure; and the frailties of language — when words can't, or mustn't, be enough. He's staged exhibitions and events around the UK and at the Cité de la Mode et du Design in Paris, with other venues including Fuse Art Space, Lowry, and Bristol Folk House. He's performed at Bluedot (Jodrell Bank), Festival Number 6, St John on Bethnal Green, Sounds from the Other City, Koko, Manchester Art Gallery, and Supersonic. Broadcasts include ARTE TV, BBC R1, BBC R6 Music (Best of 2015), NTS, and TF1.<br>Xhi Ndubisi and Jo Manby are artist-writers whose monthly series for the Fourdrinier, *Passing Cloud*, takes the form of a conversations with an imagined AI baby.

**Ben Hodge** · *Dating for Fat People*         
         
This informational video invites you on a date with a man. That man is fat.<br>Can he hide the truth from his date? Will the date go successfully even with his large body?<br>Join Ben as he explores fat attractiveness and the pressure to impress a date, knowing his body is one that comes with many expectations; not many of those expectations are good.         
         
Ben is a comedian, improvisor, and storyteller, currently studying an MA in Queer Performance at Rose Bruford. Ben's humorous approach to his identity as a fat, transmasculine person has seen him earn the title of one of Liverpool's Top 30 under 30. Ben has performed across the country at notable venues as well as festivals such as Brighton Fringe & Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Ben is currently writing his new show *Build-a-Bear*, exploring comfortability in a fat, queer body.

**Shahireh Sharif** · *Downhill Blues*         
         
A monologue that uses the Swiss cheese analogy to explore discrimination.<br>'Ownership', 'labelling', 'dehumanisation', and 'obedience without critical thinking and maintaining ethical standards' can lead to moral exclusion. And in turn, it could result in turning a blind eye to genocide.         
         
Shahireh is a multidisiplinary artist interested in exploring gender, identity, and race.

**Xhi Ndubisi** · *The apologetics of Icarus*         
         
*What right do we have to tell the story of black boys? In an environment where violence is perpetrated daily on women by men, why should we think about broken boys and misformed men? Why expend limited energy on contemplating their fragility or their needs? When we are dying. When we are robbed of purpose.<br>Let me tell you about Artemis, her mother Leto, her aunt Delos, and her brother Apollo. Let me tell you about my brother and possibly yours. Let me tell you about Icarus.*

**Rachel Smith** · *MOTHER DARK*         
         
*Apparently 'rescuing' is enabling and 'helping' is the sunny side of control.<br>But when there's nothing left to catch people, how do we let go?*<br>A propulsive ride through co-dependence, mothers' revenge, recovery, and re-connection. A true-life story that may or may not have happened. If you love self-help groups, the 90s, and Thelma and Louise, if you yearn in these times for a (dark) mother — this show is for you.         
         
A solo show with dramaturgy from Annie Siddons, mentorship from Ursula Martinez, and development funding from Arts Council England.

**Leah Stone** · *Sex & Neurodivergence*          
         
A delightfully edgy mix of sex positive disability and trauma-informed advocacy and survival laid out in silly girly packaging; weird, moving, funny, and random.<br>The perfect way to spend an evening amidst the global chaos.
