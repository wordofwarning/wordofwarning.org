*Presented by* Word of Warning + Contact *as a semi-regular event*         
         
*HIGH STEAKS* is a show about labia, labia-shaming, cosmetic surgery, and fundamentally, body lovin'.          
          
Award-winning, queer performer, ELOINA, hangs two beef steaks from her labia, butchers them up, and sizzles them on a grill.           
          
And…her mum is in the show.
