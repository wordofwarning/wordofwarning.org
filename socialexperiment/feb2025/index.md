**J. Edgar Staubsauger** · *The Peculiar case of Dr Jekyll & the Hyde family*         
         
Henry Jekyll is a respectable man of science, a good neighbour, and a regular churchgoer. But recently he has begun using experimental drugs to become something very different…<br>So begins a seedy double life, with the mild-mannered gentleman unleashing a series of outlandish alter-egos in order to live out his dormant desires.<br>Will these monstrous forces consume him — or will society itself be forced to adapt to this outrageous new being? All will be revealed…         
         
Mr Staubsauger has long been an enigma, a sinister force lurking in the shadows of the art world. Now he has emerged into the daylight to reveal himself…

Taking a look behind closed doors at how we act when we think no one is watching.<br>*Representing myself raw, unrefined, uncensored. What happens when the private is mediated in the public domain? Simultaneously unbridled and contained. Are you watching me become my most true version of myself — or watching me slowly descend into madness?*
