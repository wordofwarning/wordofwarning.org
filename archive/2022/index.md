#### About         
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy, and to also introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond, including livestreams and more online…          
>*If you haven’t attended one of these performance evenings yet, WTF are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that's out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews on WTF Wednesdays (November 2019)</a>        
      
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. Over the past decade we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Ron Athey, Harry Clayton-Wright, Chanje Kunda, Stacy Makishi, Pinchbeck & Smith, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater, and Proud & Loud Arts (amongst others).

#### Audiences         
We don't want to put you off by talking art form labels — yes, there'll be theatre, live art, performance, dance, etc. — as our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So, if you like comedy, music, gaming, or want a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on…         
>*Astonishing. Like nothing else. Transformative, immersive, moving.*<br>*Always special, bringing the unexpected and intriguing, thank you.*<br>*Fabulous for seeing things different from the mainstream machine.<br>Really important and interesting work, different to everything else.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience feedback

#### By         
Word of Warning is a project by Manchester-based [hÅb](/hab) — you might not have heard of us though you may know some of our events, like [Emergency](http://emergencymcr.org), [Haphazard](http://haphazardmcr.org), or [Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org). Read last year's interview with <a href="https://circlesandstalls.com/2021/09/17/an-interview-with-word-of-warnings-tamsin-drury" target="_blank">Circles & Stalls</a>.         
          
hÅb produces, develops, and advocates for Live Art, contemporary performance, and sited work in the North of England. We're supported using public funding by <a href="http://artscouncil.org.uk/our-investment/national-portfolio-2018-22" target="_blank">Arts Council England</a>; a core <a href="http://divergencymcr.org" target="_blank">Divergency</a> partner alongside STUN — encouraging diversity in live art; a <a href="http://gm-artisthub.co.uk" target="_blank">Greater Manchester Artist Hub</a> partner; a GM LGBTQ+ Arts and Culture Network member; a <a href="http://liveartuk.org" target="_blank">Live Art UK</a> member; a <a href="https://manchesterindependents.org" target="_blank">Manchester Independents</a> partner — supporting and spotlighting GM artists.         
>*Refreshing company that brings diverse shows to our door steps.*<br>*WoW are great, supporting emerging work and bringing it to new audiences.*<br>*Wonderful, daring performances that I have never been disappointed by.<br>A needed company in Manchester, feels like they really support artists.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience feedback

#### People        
Tamsin Drury, hÅb's Director, has been around a while — a really long while — she's been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape, and firing a glitter-cannon to the *Hallelujah* chorus! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has worked with hundreds of NW artists to help them create new work. Please send programming enquiries to her via <mailto:info@habmcr.org>        
        
John Franklin-Johnston, hÅb's Programme Manager, is a freelance producer, events manager, facilitator, and was <a href="http://greenroomarts.org" target="_blank">greenroom</a>'s programme co-ordinator.
