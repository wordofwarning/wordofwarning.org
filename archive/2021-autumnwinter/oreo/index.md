*Oreo, coconut, Bounty Bar* — micro-aggressions used to disempower a black person deemed to be 'acting white'.        
        
Donning a camouflage of Oreo-filling, Tania explores the masks we wear to put our heads above the parapet in a climate of systemic racism.

#### About         
A semi-autobiographical solo about being a successfully educated black woman within western society, *Oreo* interrogates racial micro-aggressions and their effect on mental health within private and public personas — focusing on public figures such as British MP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott" target="_blank">Diane Abbott</a> + Portuguese politician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joacine_Katar_Moreira" target="_blank">Joacine Katar Moreira</a>.        
        
Exploring the racial term 'Oreo' in relation to experiences of episodic racism within higher education and employment, Tania challenges the notion of whitening her physical and phenomenal self to achieve success in society.        
         
*Oreo* developed from, and is inspired by, difficult conversations and the complexities of what it means to be black in Great Britain. As a black EU national living in the UK, Tania uses *Oreo* to investigate the mechanisms of survival black women use to protect themselves and endure the current hostile times.         
         
#### Artist          
A Manchester-based solo performance artist, Tania works across devised theatre, dance, site-specific, live art, installation, video + photography. A graduate of the University of Amsterdam with an MA, she uses her cultural heritage, past experiences, research, and the interdisciplinary structure of Batuku (including singing, dancing, drums + spoken word).        
        
Tania's current practice focuses on personal accounts of memory, collective and ancestral, to uncover her racial and cultural identity; the concept of self and other; belonging and the black performing body.        
       
Tania is a member of <a href="http://inbetweentime.co.uk/creative-exchange-lab" target="_blank">In Between Time's Creative Exchange Lab</a> + <a href="http://thelowry.com/about-us/artist-development/class-of-programme" target="_blank">The Lowry's Class of 2020</a>.
