*A season under construction — from a [one-off, never to be repeated trip around a building in transition](/archive/2015-domestic), to a [sweet sixteenth](/archive/2015-emergency), with a [digital swirl of dance](/archive/2015-autumnwinter/pritchard) and the [beatification of an old friend](/archive/2015-autumnwinter/makishi).*          
		
Brought to you by hÅb with Contact, The Guinness Partnership, Sustained Theatre Up North (STUN) + Z-arts, we look forward to seeing you at some or all of Autumn/Winter 2015. If you want to check out what happened last season take a look at our [Spring/Summer 2015 archive](/archive/2015-springsummer).        
         
#### What is Word of Warning + where did it come from?
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond…        
          
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. In 2012, alongside funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of Third Angel, Ellie Harrison, Levantes Dance Theatre, Action Hero, Richard DeDomenici and many more, we served the audience gin + satsuma jello shots and drenched them in confetti. 2013's whirlwind of work included Lowri Evans, Hetain Patel, the vacuum cleaner, Leentje Van de Cruys + Stacy Makishi, a bonkers day of live art for all ages (Haphazard) and a performance festival for a 70s block of flats (Domestic). 2014 included Proto-type Theater, Ira Brand, Rachel Mars, Two Destination Language, Selina Thompson + Michael Pinchbeck, with a fifth wave of bizarre behaviour unleashed upon Manchester's city centre (Hazard) ranging from a manual fairground ride to beautiful and transgressive images from Nicola + Kris Canavan. 2015 has so far seen another Haphazard-ous afternoon for all ages, Hunt & Darton's pop-up art-café and welcomed Christopher Brett Bailey, Ria Hartley + Mark Thomas amongst others.

#### Who's it for? Anyone looking for a different night (or day) out.            
We don't want to put you off by talking labels – yes there'll be theatre, live art, dance – the aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming or just a friendly, stimulating evening – there'll be something you might want to take a chance on.

#### Who is Word of Warning?         
My name's Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called **[hÅb](/hab)**, which was greenroom's partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events – like **Emergency** (Manchester's free marathon of live work, now in its sixteenth year) and **Hazard** (biennial random sprees of eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).

I've been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I've been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon Hallelujah chorus! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young NW artists to help them create new pieces of theatre + dance.
          
Please send programming enquiries to me at <mailto:info@habarts.org>             

I'm joined in this lunacy by John Franklin, greenroom's long time programme co-ordinator. Often spotted in a hat or proffering a variety of bizarre refreshments, John is the friendly face greeting you and eliciting your feedback at many of our events. We are also grateful for the support of a growing band of current and former interns — to date Tom Burford, Afreena Islam, Catherine Shaw + Jamil Keating.
