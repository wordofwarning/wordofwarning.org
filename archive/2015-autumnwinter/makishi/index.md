#### More      
Last seen in [2013's performance to die for](/archive/2013-autumnwinter/makishi), Stacy Makishi returns to Manchester in a solo show that draws on her stand-up comedy roots and theatrical sense of the uncanny… Looking at loss and mourning, and Stacy's one-time wish to be a missionary, *Vesper Time* weaves together the undercurrents of *Moby Dick* alongside 80s and 90s pop culture to offer up a 'vesper', a secular evening prayer.             
       
#### Who is she?     
Stacy Makishi is a transplant from Hawaii who found paradise in Dalston, East London in 1994.            
       
After graduating from the University of Hawaii she worked as a stand-up comic at the Comedy Store: but when her punchlines punched back, Stacy found herself happiest when making what New Yorkers called 'Performance'.            
       
Her present body of work is interdisciplinary in scope and includes live art, film, installation and visual art. Her work is as complex as it is accessible; humorous as it is challenging; visual as it is literate.          
       
A workshop leader and mentor of international renown, Makishi opens her making processes to the public through workshops, open rehearsals and talks, alongside performances.             
       
She has been awarded an ICA Attached Artist Award, a Millennium Fellowship Award, a Live Art Development Agency One to One Bursary, an Artsadmin Bursary and the Franklin Furnace Award. She is an Associate Artist with Artsadmin, Chelsea Theatre and New Unity.
