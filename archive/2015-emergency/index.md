### Saturday 3 October 2015, 12noon-10pm. FREE             
**Manchester's manic micro-marathon of the bizarre + the beautiful celebrates sweet sixteen — from gallery to theatre, store-cupboard to stairwell, some 25 live works in a non-stop performance takeover.**         
         
Now that it's over, have a look at the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-emergency) + read <a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2015/10/emergency-at-z-arts" target="_blank">QuietManDave's review</a>.           
          
[From noon](/archive/2015-emergency/afternoon), dip in and out of ongoing performances — from virtual reality to physical anxiety — all over the building: a couple defy the sands of time, grain by grain; a man elevates the humble cabbage to the heights of celebrity; and a woman bends, literally, under the strain…           
         
[Then from 4pm](/archive/2015-emergency/evening) join us for a series of short sit-down shows in a variety of spaces — from stand-up with a twist, to a manic roller derby and a raunchy celebratory climax.
