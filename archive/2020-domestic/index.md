What can you make when your kitchen table is the stage + your camera is the audience?<br>An assembly of artists; a collage of commentary on where we find ourselves now…        
         
#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so **[July](/archive/2020-domestic/july)** began a series of "Domestic at homes", continuing in **[August](/archive/2020-domestic/august)** & **[October](/archive/2020-domestic/october)**, with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.        
        
Real lives, real stories, real homes.         
        
[Domestic](/hab/domestic) 2020 hosted by Peader Kirk + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
