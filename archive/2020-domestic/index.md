What can you make when your kitchen table is the stage + your camera is the audience? An assembly of artists; a collage of commentary on where we found ourselves in 2020…        
         
#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in [2020](/archive/2020-domestic) our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so we began a series of "Domestic at homes" in **[July](/archive/2020-domestic/july)** (<a href="http://youtu.be/IUNv7CARKLU" target="_blank">watch livestream</a>), continuing in **[August](/archive/2020-domestic/august)** (<a href="http://youtu.be/AOT29ZTtZAA" target="_blank">livestream</a>) and **[October](/archive/2020-domestic/october)** (<a href="http://youtu.be/seg57Z8-mfk" target="_blank">livestream</a>), with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.        
        
Real lives, real stories, real homes.         
        
[Domestic](/hab/domestic) 2020 series was an informal online platform for artists to beta test new work, live from their homes; hosted by Peader Kirk; produced by [hÅb](/hab).
