#### In Brief

#### More      
*Well, Dr Freud tells me I'm missing something and I think he's right. He tells me that until I get over it and turn my desire for that missing thing into a desire for a baby I'm gonna be in deep shit. He also tells me he doesn't really get chicks…*           
         
Invoking the ghost of Sigmund Freud, this energetic solo works through MacAskill’s penis envy, while displaying her undeniable womanhood… through crotchless chaps! Aided by a macho cowboy, a hysterical woman with anger issues, a patriarchal DIY expert and the famous talking horse, Mr Ed, she ponders if she does, indeed, have penis envy — or if it's all a load of bollocks!    
        
A stripped-back solo show for anyone who likes their psychoanalysis heteronormative and their cowboys in the buff.         
        
#### Who is she?     
Glasgow-based, Eilidh MacAskill creates performances and projects that sit somewhere between theatre, live art and visual art, inspired by nature and how we human animals live in the world. She is Artistic Director of Fish & Game, making entertaining experimental performances, particularly for children, and is a freelance performer.    

*STUD* represents a shift in her practice and is part of a wider enquiry into gender and queer theory called the Gendersaurus Rex project: supported by Imaginate, it looks particularly at representation of queerness, sexuality and difference in children's theatre, and *Gendersaurus Rex: The Clothes Show* will appear later in February during [Haphazard 2016](/archive/2016-haphazard).
