#### More        
A performance of and about sleight-of-hand magic: its invisible mechanics, its clichés, and what it tells us about live theatre and make-believe.              
         
In a conversational yet crafted approach, Gambini presents astonishing close-up magic that invites us to question how enchantment and wonder are produced. Possibly the first of its kind, *This is not a magic show* is part performance-lecture, part deconstructed showbiz, and part magic trick that leaves you, like, *omg!*         
        
The evening kicks off with a guest appearance by Liverpool comedy stalwart,  Top Joe, with his own unique take on life and magic.    
        
#### Who is Vincent Gambini?    
London-based, over the last decade his performances have taken him across Europe, the US + South America. Specialising in sleight-of-hand with cards and coins, performed at very close quarters, he combines magic with elements of theatre, performance art, spoken word — all to create new forms of deception.        
        
As a teen he won 1st prize at the Italian Close-up Magic competition, and 2nd prize at the International competition in London. In 2001 he gained entry to the Magic Circle by writing a thesis called 'Deconstucting Magic' which, as a title, does a good job at describing what he does now.
