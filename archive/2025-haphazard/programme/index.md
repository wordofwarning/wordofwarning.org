Theatre, occurs three times<br>**Shannon Mulvey** · *FRANKENDIVA!*         
         
A glorious, glitter-soaked monster of a show, *FRANKENDIVA!* is stomping back — bigger, bolder, and even more unapologetically fabulous. 💥🧷💋         
         
Part pop party, part power anthem, this high-energy, interactive performance is inspired by Frankenstein — but instead of creating a monster, we're building a DIVA. With the help of the audience, piece by piece, she comes to life in all her fierce, messy glory. Expect iconic pop, franken-glam aesthetics, and a wild celebration of individuality, empowerment, and rejecting society's expectations.        

**At 3.30pm**, join us for the *FRANKENDIVA! DISCO* — a full-throttle, all-in, stomp-it-out dance party where everyone gets up to unleash their inner diva. 💃⚡️ Let's build a diva. Together. One stomp at a time. 💄🩹

First floor, Artists Studio from 1.30pm<br>**Madame Zucchini** · *Hot Political Potato Gameshow*         
         
*Come and see the veg characters Mme Z has created — could Nigel Cabbage be there? What about Tayto Swift? Do you want to throw potatoes at them in her Veg Shy, reminiscent of fetes with a dash of the horticultural show? Do you want to create your own character to add to the lineup? Feel free to take your creation with you.*         
         
Madame Zucchini entertains with vegetables, and sometimes with fruit. She creates her own veg puppet shows (like Pirates of the Carrotbean with Capn Jack Marrow & Kiwi Knightley), runs veg craft sessions, and even dresses up in various vegetable guises.
