What a clown? Sad. Mad… Disabled.         
        
Through Macabre, the goth clown, Helena talks of her own experiences of being a visually impaired woman. She cries, laughs, and reminisces. Her microphone isn't even plugged in…         
         
A short film that examines how being disabled makes you feel like you are the clown in the room — now available to watch on our <a href="http://bit.ly/YTwarnmcr" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
