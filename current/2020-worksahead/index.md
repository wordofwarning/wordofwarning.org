*Presented by* Word of Warning + Contact as Works Ahead on 26+27 May 2022       
        
2022's sample of new work-in-development picks back up where we were so rudely interrupted in 2020 — presenting the now-finished live performance of Will Dickie's *White Sun* alongside a re-imagined development of Ross McCaffrey's *Sometimes History Needs A Push*.
        
In 2021 we also commissioned new developments from Helena Ascough and Jade Williams — we now present the digital outcome of Helena's *What A Clown!* with Jade's work coming to fruition in 2023.        
        
Get a feel for Works Ahead with a look at [2019](/archive/2019-worksahead).
