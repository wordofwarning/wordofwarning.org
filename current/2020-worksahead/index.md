### Thursday 16 + Friday 17 May 2019, 7.30pm        
A risky night out or a good night in? Two explorations of inner conflict, outer division, and the politics of oppression from [Mark Croasdale](/archive/2019-worksahead/croasdale) + [Avital Raz](/archive/2019-worksahead/raz).             
            
Our annual sampler of new performance is a double bill of new works in development from artists at the start of their journeys; now that it's over, see images from their [shows](/galleries/2019-woah). Get a feel for Works Ahead with a look at [2018](/archive/2018-worksahead).
