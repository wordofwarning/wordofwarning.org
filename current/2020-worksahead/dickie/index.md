#### About         
>*No lights. No music. No props. Moving. And speaking. And moving and speaking. And skanking and moving and speaking. Some nodding. Pulsing. Also bopping. And shaking. And shaking shaking. Scrambling. And speaking. And pointing.<br><br>Pointing at the space when others see my face.<br>Pointing at addiction and how that makes us who we are.<br>Pointing at divorce and how that makes us who we are.<br>Pointing at Britain and old actors and privilege and how that makes me who I am.<br>Pointing at the Sun and speaking about white golden things.*        
        
Today, Britain continues to benefit from its colonial past. A nation passionately caught up with being right, being the exception to the rule, and making profit at any cost. Children of divorced parents are 50% more likely to develop mental health problems. Addiction is a primary cause of preventable death; ruining lives, and consuming vast amounts of medical resources.           
         
Will is white, British, straight, and privately educated. He grew up in a wealthy suburb inside the M25 and now lives in a Victorian house in Liverpool. Divorced parents; addictions to food, exercise, and attention. Is there a way of coming to terms with this identity, this past, and his privilege? Any hope? Any space for a voice and moving body beyond a maelstrom of inequality?         
              
**[Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead)** is our annual sample of new performance — 2020's edition was planned as a sited double bill from Will Dickie + Ross McCaffrey at NIAMOS in partnership with Contact on 21/22 May: Will adapted his work for livestreaming; Ross postponed sharing his work until it can be shown to a physical audience.
