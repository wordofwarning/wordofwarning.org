**Noon-1.30pm** Julie Burrow · *Tumbola*         
          
Roll up, roll up! Come and take a spin on the *Tumbola*. Is anything more fun than a dread feeling in your stomach? A grubby man awaits you, part-music hall performer, part-village fete game with a tombola fused to his abdomen — the Tumbola. Turn the handle and win a prize.
