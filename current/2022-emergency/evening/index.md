*Nine Five Five Less Than or Equal To Nine Nine Six* is an interactive audiovisual-physical performance that provides a unique view of an employee in the race for success. A dialogue between two performers, human and audiovisual; live video loops of the performer are manipulated in real time using computer vision algorithms to question, challenge, and see the person behind the job title, in a bid for workplace well-being.

*Cat Lady! Dried up spinster! Barren ghost! Frigid witch!*<br>Poignant and revelatory; an autobiographical performance scrutinising and celebrating one woman’s decision to remain child-free.<br>Kerensa considers her mother’s desire for grandchildren, cracks open the canon of capitalism, mourns her lack of female role models, and embarks on a quest to become a wild and free childless goddess.

**6.30pm** Christian Asare · *Diasporic Identity — an Exploration*         
        
My tone, my vocabulary, my gait, my orientation — does it make me British? Ghanaian? Or something other?<br>Doing my traditional dance in traditional robes and European medieval armament, would I feel like a Ghanaian Brit — channelling something ancient and intrinsic? Or a British Ghanaian — trying my hand at something I don’t really know? This performance explores the intersection of the various cultural influences that form my diasporic identity.         
         
A Divergency seed commission.

**7pm** Bold Mellon Collective · *KLAZO*        
        
A raw, autobiographical dive into contrasting experiences of the onset of Tourette’s Syndrome.<br>Treading between vulnerable and absurd, two tourettic movers mirror and oppose each other to create a visual foray into the breakdown of identity that coincides with the development of disability. Through organic movement, Live Art, and body prints, they explore tics and their connection to self-control to redefine the relationship between body and mind.         
         
A devised collaboration by Maddie Mellon, Dan Jones, Emilia Nurmukhametova · Designed by Tainted Saint · Original music by Kay Rowan.

**8pm** Emergency Chorus · *All the Barometers in the World*         
         
Through a cloud of uncertainty, *AtBitW* attempts to predict the future, to know what cannot be known. Leeches squirm in anticipation of the coming storm, stock brokers hedge their bets, and mystics foretell a great rupture.<br>A work-in-progress performance of a new duet.

Currently they are preoccupied with crisis and capitalism, intimacy and collaboration, ecology and networks, precarity and the future.

**8.30pm** Josh Coates & Alicia Jane Turner · *Metal Music*        
        
A group of metal heads, emos, grebs, goths, moshers, and punks walk in to a theatre. They walk on stage and scream. They scream about the things they are doing and what they want to be doing. Things will be getting loud. Things are loud already. We just want to be louder.

**9pm** Kellie Colbert · *This Is Dedicated To The One I Love*

**9.30pm** Bitterroot · *If it's to Break*         
         
Your soft clay is put in an oven to cook and harden. It either splits, cracks, breaks… or it holds. Is it up to you to decide if it's to break or if it's to hold?<br>A dark, atmospheric piece exploring mental health, self-acceptance, and failure in art. Driven by body-based work in collaboration with Michael Pinchbeck, with an original sound score composed by Chris Richards, this performance asks the ancient question, ‘what does it mean to make art?’         
         
Bitterroot is a newly-formed theatre collective comprising Jake Rayner Blair & Chris Richards. Their debut was at Bath Fringe Festival in Summer 22 and they are looking to develop *If it's to Break* for touring.
