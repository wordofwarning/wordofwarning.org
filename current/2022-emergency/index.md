#### About         
Responding to circumstances, our 21st Emergency offers a sneak preview of new live work in a brand new home. With about ten performance works dotted throughout <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>'s building, you'll be guided on a socially-distanced one-way walkthrough. Able to pause en route, we *estimate* a 60 to 75-minute total journey time for each audience member.
