*Oreo, coconut, Bounty Bar* — micro-aggressions used to disempower a black person deemed to be 'acting white'.

#### About         
A semi-autobiographical solo about being a successfully educated black woman within western society. *Oreo Prelude* goes back to the beginning of the story, taking the words of British MP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott" target="_blank">Diane Abbott</a> to interrogate systemic racism and its effect on mental health within private and public personas.        
         
*Oreo Prelude* is being developed through a commission from <a href="http://inbetweentime.co.uk" target="_blank">In Between Time</a> in collaboration with [hÅb](/hab)/[Word of Warning](/).         
        
#### Artist          
A Manchester-based solo performance artist, Tania Camara works across devised theatre, dance, site-specific, live art, installation, video + photography. A graduate of the University of Amsterdam with an MA, she uses her cultural heritage, past experiences, research, and the interdisciplinary structure of Batuku (including singing, dancing, drums + spoken word).        
        
Tania's current practice focuses on personal accounts of memory, collective and ancestral, to uncover her racial and cultural identity; the concept of self and other; belonging and the black performing body.        
       
Tania is a member of <a href="http://inbetweentime.co.uk/creative-exchange-lab" target="_blank">In Between Time's Creative Exchange Lab</a> + <a href="http://thelowry.com/about-us/artist-development/class-of-programme" target="_blank">The Lowry's Class of 2020</a>.
