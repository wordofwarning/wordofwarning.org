How are walls felt through bodies and generations? How might political walls be brought down? A performance exploring the experience of restricted movement across borders — real and imaginary, current and historical.        
        
Developed from interviews and research about the ways that people find to circumvent or overcome restrictions, *Concord* invites you to consider how walls are made, how they're embodied, and how they might be dismantled.

#### About         
*Concord* developed from Dani's research into political walls and borders, and from her own and her family's lived experience of the separation wall in Israel/Palestine. She conducted research and interviews with a range of people who have experience of political separation from different contexts across the world — including the Berlin Wall, Korea, Cyprus, China, the US, and others.        
        
Exploring their audio testimonies through movement, Dani developed a series of short choreographies that she performs alongside her father — born in Occupied Palestine in 1955, Jamal is an untrained performer.         
         
With audio material presented alongside movement, *Concord* is shown within a structure designed to look, feel, and behave as complex and cumbersome as the politics that underpin it.         
         
#### Artist          
A British-Palestinian interdisciplinary artist based in Manchester, Dani has been making work since 2005. Her background and training are in performance, movement, and skateboarding; her work often explores the lived experience and politics of specific spaces and places.        
        
A Lecturer in Contemporary Applied Performance at the University of Leeds, she's also co-founder of <a href="https://accumulationsproject.com" target="_blank">Accumulations</a> — a Manchester-based collective and supportive network for the development of experimental movement, dance, and performance.
