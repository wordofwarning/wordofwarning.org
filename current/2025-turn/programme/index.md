**Dais Leach** · *Echoes of the Isle*         
          
This contemporary dance piece reimagines Caliban from *The Tempest*, transforming Shakespeare's traditionally ridiculed character into a symbol of human vulnerability. Interplaying spoken word, animalistic movement, and humanised gesture, the choreography explores Caliban's longing for comfort, belonging, and a place to call home. Structured around rhythms inspired by Shakespearean iambic pentameter, the piece highlights both poetic order and life's inherent unpredictability. Caliban's journey reflects the unpredictability of modern existence, where stability can vanish in an instant, and highlights the human instinct to seek both inner and outer peace.         
         
Dais is a Manchester-based dancer and freelance choreographer. She has performed, choreographed, and taught with various dance companies, groups, and community projects across Greater Manchester. Her personal choreographic practice involves blending traditional Shakespearean texts with contemporary dance — seeking to make Shakespeare more accessible, engaging, and inclusive for today's audience.

**Emmy Lahouel (Meraki Collective)** · *On Land & Lines & Other Space*         

A new dance theatre work-in-progress exploring myth, memory, and belief. Blending movement, live music, layered soundscapes, and video projection, it examines the stories we inherit — about gods, history, and ourselves — inviting us to reflect on what we choose to believe and why. Rooted in folklore, lived experience, and cultural inquiry, this work doesn't offer answers but instead creates a moment for reflection, questioning, and navigating the unknown. How does it all end, or is it start?

**Maelstrom Theatre** · *Unapologetic (work-in-progress)*         
         
A darkly comedic dance-theatre work exploring the shifting visibility of women in the dance industry. Through a fusion of contemporary, commercial, and mixed media movement with character-driven text, the piece follows performers at different career stages — emerging dancers in their 20s, established artists in their 30s, and seasoned professionals in their 40s and 50s — grappling with the pressures of recognition, opportunity, and longevity in an industry that often renders them invisible.
