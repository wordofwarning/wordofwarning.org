**Dais Leach** · *Echoes of the Isle*         
          
This contemporary dance piece reimagines Caliban from *The Tempest*, transforming Shakespeare's traditionally ridiculed character into a symbol of human vulnerability. Interplaying spoken word, animalistic movement, and humanised gesture, the choreography explores Caliban's longing for comfort, belonging, and a place to call home. Structured around rhythms inspired by Shakespearean iambic pentameter, the piece highlights both poetic order and life's inherent unpredictability. Caliban's journey reflects the unpredictability of modern existence, where stability can vanish in an instant, and highlights the human instinct to seek both inner and outer peace.

**UMAMI&#8209;i!&#8209;MOVEMENT** · *Lean In*         
         
Lean In: commit completely or more fully to something, especially when faced with difficulty or resistance.<br>Lean In: how close we really are when in relation to another. We explore what intimacy looks like when co-located with platonic care, disentangled from the explicitly sexual.<br>Lean In: exists as a counterpoint to aesthetic as outcome.<br>UMAMI-i!-MOVEMENT seeks to push back against the labelling of life's minutiae, platforming intimacy as social reform.
