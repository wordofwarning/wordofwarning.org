**Dais Leach** · *Echoes of the Isle*         
          
This contemporary dance piece reimagines Caliban from *The Tempest*, transforming Shakespeare's traditionally ridiculed character into a symbol of human vulnerability.<br>Interplaying spoken word, animalistic movement, and humanised gesture, the choreography explores Caliban's longing for comfort, belonging, and a place to call home. Structured around rhythms inspired by Shakespearean iambic pentameter, the piece highlights both poetic order and life's inherent unpredictability. Caliban's journey reflects the unpredictability of modern existence, where stability can vanish in an instant, and highlights the human instinct to seek both inner and outer peace.         
         
Dais is a Manchester-based dancer and freelance choreographer. They has performed, choreographed, and taught with various dance companies, groups, and community projects across Greater Manchester. Their personal choreographic practice involves blending traditional Shakespearean texts with contemporary dance — seeking to make Shakespeare more accessible, engaging, and inclusive for today's audience.

**Emmy Lahouel (Meraki Collective)** · *On Land & Lines & Other Space*         

A new dance theatre work-in-progress exploring myth, memory, and belief.<br>Blending movement, live music, layered soundscapes, and video projection, it examines the stories we inherit — about gods, history, and ourselves — inviting us to reflect on what we choose to believe and why. Rooted in folklore, lived experience, and cultural inquiry, this work doesn't offer answers but instead creates a moment for reflection, questioning, and navigating the unknown.<br>How does it all end, or is it start?

**Néa Synergy** · *Io Sono Quien Soy*         
         
A powerful and emotional dance piece that explores the experience of having a mixed-heritage background, touching on themes of self-doubt, identity, and human
connection.<br>*As two dancers, we navigate the tension of always feeling different — questioning who we are, where we belong, and why others care so much about defining us. Fear gives way to understanding, hesitation to support, and solitude to connection. Through movement, our journey begins in solitude, crawling through identities before encountering one another. The performance transitions from isolation to a celebration of culture and the embrace of our individual differences. The music shifts from poetic narration to Afro-inspired rhythms, mirroring our emotional transformation. This piece is a reminder that our differences are not barriers but the essence of what makes us whole.*
