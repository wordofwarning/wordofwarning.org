**Fabíola Santana** · *Mothers, Grandmothers, and Their (post)colonial Children*         
         
*How has colonialism impacted the care we have received from our elders? How did we experience their resilience? What nurturing strategies can we share with each other to help us thrive, in a mainstream society that seeks to racialise and dehumanise us? Can we create rituals and spaces to care for ourselves?*         
         
Three women from the Global Ethnic Majority whose families have been impacted by Colonisation — sharing their own histories of care, resilience, and legacy through the body. Going beyond everyday storytelling, transforming those energies into a live experience.

**Isaac Glenister** · *Lower Broughton*         
         
A performance highlighting the changes that went through Broughton and the surrounding area of Salford from 2000 to 2007 in which investment helped improve the infrastructure; however, it sent impulses of fear through the neighbourhood. This piece extracts inspiration from both the Salford regeneration map and Dan Glenister's artwork made at the time.         
         
Isaac is a dance artist from Manchester, recently graduated from Rambert School. Over the last year he has been freelancing in London and Manchester, often in fashion and music videos. He is currently developing and showcasing his own work.

**Jake Evans** · *Queer New World*         
         
A work-in-progress that combines dance, drag, and poetry to explore what parts of ourselves we hide from the world, and what parts we feel we can show. What we have to destroy in order to survive, and what we desperately reconstruct. What we perform for others, and what's left after the show's over.         
         
Inspired by the moments shared on disco dance floors and the makeshift stages of D-I-Y cabarets. For this piece Jake collaborated with the poet/performers Brendan Curtis & Day Mattar of Liverpool-based poetry collective Queer Bodies. This solo is intended for development into a full-length work.

*When you have been escaping all your life, are you truly willing to escape?*<br>*L'Enfant Malade* explores the bittersweet reality of being stuck in the familiarity of suffering and the repetitive cycle of trying to break out, yet not being willing to leave at the same time.<br>You can hate it, but its addictive comfort will inexorably have you love it, too.<br>*So, are you still willing to escape?*

Justyna is an independent dance artist trained in Manchester and Brussels, while also broadening her horizons in the Netherlands, Hungary, and Italy. She explores her creative side by combining dance with theatre. Having choreographed for an internationally acclaimed British independent film, *Hilda*, a few years ago, she has since been chasing the creative thrill and is now challenging herself in a vulnerable solo performance. In her movement practice, she puts a strong focus on biomechanics and psychology. Being a qualified L4 Sports Massage Therapist allows her to further indulge in movement geekiness and develop in multiple directions.

**Lily Antonia** · *Un/Seen*          

*What are the parts of ourselves that we are able to express freely in the safety of our own space… Behind closed doors, without outside eyes.*      

This work (in progress) gives a vulnerable and authentic insight into a person alone in their bedroom experiencing the fluctuations that come with solitude. Witness the interchangeability of joy, boredom, frustration, curiosity, conflict, silliness, and sorrow as we journey through states of being.         
Leaving space to ask ourselves the question: *what of us is unseen?*

**Lisa Chearles** · *Where Sleeping Dogs Lie*         
         
Two performers are illuminated and enveloped in shadow in a dance with the light and each other, scrambling from and toward the light, evading and then craving it in an ever-evolving relationship with exposure and erasure, scrutiny, and sanctuary.

**Louiseanne Wong** · *I Am. Am I (work in progress)*         
         
A human story told through movement, dance, and circus. Louiseanne explores their struggle with social norms, displacement, and unlearning how they were 'conditioned' in Hong Kong.         
        
They question labelling theory — some given, some self-identifying (e.g. from-from, foreigner) — and raise awareness of social inequalities using a fridge, sloganised T-shirts, sound design, and urban anti-establishment forms like parkour, art du deplacement, and krump.
