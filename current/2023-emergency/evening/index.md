**4pm** Gillian Dyson · *Nerve in the Bone*         
         
A meditative and uncanny performance where object and body communicate the real felt tensions of feminine aging.<br>Working on a floor of broken crockery, Dyson's performance brings together slow Butoh dance movement with body-based performance art.         
         
Costume development: Phillipa Jackson · Sound composition: Eilon Morris<br>Development of this work has been enabled with support from Arts Council England and Leeds Beckett University.

**4.30pm** Gisou Golshani · *che mishod*         
         
Through movement and chants, Gisou interprets a Persian song's wish for the universe to resolve current entanglements. Guttural and ethereal live vocals are layered onto industrial doom and drone elements. The Persian lyrics call for freedom, and a release from the trap of doomed fate.<br>This work is an exploration of renowned Iranian singer Marzieh's song from the 50s, through the lens of the present. Its poetic and allegorical lyrics demand change, both on a universal and personal level. The projection of the voice becomes a manifestation of the wishes, reifying them through repetition.         
          
Gisou Golshani is a London-based, multidisciplinary Iranian artist whose ritualistic performances use sound as a medium for multilayered storytelling, and weave together themes around ecology, Persian mythology, sexuality, and mental health. She blends fictional tales with real events to reflect on socio-political issues, and seeks to offer spaces for introspection and collective emancipation.

**5pm** new func · *A THE Thing is moving*         
         
A movement to narrate and connect to all that is (all that is, in this moment, this space, in your perception).<br>A participatory performance in which disparate narration of what exists to you, explodes into communal song of everything that interweaves through us, and brings us closer to our selves, others, and environment.         
         
new func is a series of events exploring new ways of being.<br>*Through participatory performances we experiment with the actions necessary to life; questioning how we live and how to feel alive. We breathe, drink, eat, greet, walk, think, clean, sleep, and trade… in greater connection with self, other, and environment.*

**5.30pm** Laurie Bayley-Higgins · *The Santa Ana*         
         
*"On nights like that," Raymond Chandler once wrote about the Santa Ana, "every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen." That was the kind of wind it was.* — Joan Didion, 'Slouching towards Bethlehem'         
A live multimedia exploration of Didion's 1968 essay on the Santa Ana winds, the piece offers snapshots of scenes exploring the lives thrown into turmoil during these winds, as suicide rates increase and neighbours roam their front gardens with machetes. The piece interrogates the relationship between the environment and our mental health. It questions whether a strong wind is all it takes to tip people over the edge, whether all this chaos is perhaps constantly gurgling under the surface. It explores the things we blame which allow us to shirk personal responsibilities to our individual and collective problems.

*What is Addiction? What are we addicted to and why?<br>What are our and your stories of Addiction?*<br>A show that explores the reasons for personal and cultural addiction to all things: around and about what we feel, and what we need just to get us through the day (and night), and the stories we tell ourselves about it to make it alright.

**6.30pm** Alex Billingham · *Salting the Wound*

**7pm** Heather Alice · *I, The Girl.*         
         
A personal reclamation of the 'hysterical' woman, and a reflection on the paradoxes created by a society that has historically gendered madness. A fragmented and distorted journey through lived experience and complex representation — contemporary movement practices and transmedia storytelling offer a shattering and intimate insight into the mind of a woman on the edge. It explores and considers why Hollywood actresses so often win awards for portrayals of disorder, how medical misogyny shapes our archetypes, and how these depictions in pop culture influence neurodiverse young women.         
         
Writer/Performer: Heather Alice · Special thanks to: Director, Joshua Allen; Videography by Daniel Povey, Chloe Holford, Steven Gallagher; Emily Eastwood; Vocals by Lara Rose Hancox.
