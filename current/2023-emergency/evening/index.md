**4pm** Gillian Dyson · *Nerve in the Bone*         
         
A meditative and uncanny performance where object and body communicate the real felt tensions of feminine aging. Working on a floor of broken crockery, Dyson's performance brings together slow Butoh dance movement with body-based performance art.         
         
Costume development: Phillipa Jackson. Sound composition: Eilon Morris.<br>Development of this work has been enabled with support from Arts Council England and Leeds Beckett University.
