**Noon-4pm** E.M. Parry · *Pricklings*          
         
*Pricklings* stages the artist's body as trans saint, queer icon, fetish object, witch's poppet, a luck charm, a ritual, a process, a test, a game.<br>It investigates trans embodiment and bodily autonomy, and pokes at the edges between self/other, flesh/costume, performer/spectator, artefact/event: remixing and repurposing religious, historical, artistic, medical, and magical iconography to create intimate spectacles and new rituals of becoming.          
         
E.M. Parry is a trans\*-disciplinary artist, designer, and performance-maker, working across scenography, drag, live & visual art, specialising in work which centres queer bodies and narratives. Flitting between genres and platforms, their work has been staged in the West End, international opera stages, pubs, clubs, cabarets, ships, lecture halls, and leaky basements. They work with, through, and for the queer body, squinting at history, flirting with ghosts and the things that go bump in the margins.

**Noon-4pm** Louise Ward Morris · *You and I*         
         
Technology is our established method for perceiving the world. In turn, our technology becomes ourselves and our world. *You and I* investigates the alternative forms of perception and embodiment that can evolve from a modification of this relationship using VR & YouTube. This Live Art piece creates the experience of real life through the glitchy nuances of the internet.         
       
Generously funded by CuratorSpace & ClassRoom Gallery.         
         
Louise Ward Morris is an award-winning sculptor working with new media and videos. Her work questions the ever-intensifying connection between people, technology, and the environment.

**12.30pm** Kelvin Atmadibrata · *His Fishies Friends Are Sticking Around*         
         
Easy to see why he received the anglers' apotheosis.        
          
Kelvin Atmadibrata recruits superpowers awakened by puberty and adolescent fantasy, personifying power and strength into fanfiction antiheroes to contest the masculine meta and erotica. He works primarily with performances, often accompanied by and translated into drawings, mixed media collages, and objects compiled as installations. Approached as bricolages, Kelvin translates narratives and recreates personifications based on role-playing video game theories and pop mythologies.

**12.30pm-2.30pm** Luisa Amorim · *Idleness*        
        
*Traditional gender roles are still prevalent in our society, especially in a domestic environment. Women are still expected to put their careers on hold to raise children and spend more extra hours on household or childcare than men. Women keep doing the majority of the invisible work and Idleness is about that. It is also about the quest for alternative forms of communication, such as body movement, and sounds other than the articulated word.*<br>A sensorial show in a loop. A game of movement and sound that invites you to go on a trip through a woman's baby blues and her everyday life.        
        
Luisa Amorim is a performance maker based in London and the curator of Discotheque. She spent a long time experimenting on dramatising the quotidian through participatory work.<br>Jadelin Gangbo is a novelist, published in Italy and Poland and about to have his first novel written in English published.<br>Simon Engerer is a handyman and expert in a bit of everything; back in Berlin, he was working as a music engineer.

**1pm**/**2pm**/**3pm** Porcelain Delaney · *Parade of The Disregarded*         
         
An urgent and timely story in three acts; a contemporary movement-performance inspired by ballet *The parade* as a personal response to how disabled people were treated during the pandemic. In the first act the character is happy, joyful, and free, dancing outside of the box; in the second she is trapped in the box and battles confusion, rage, and hopelessness; act three is celebratory and eerie as she is finally free to leave.         
         
Originally created for the anniversary of the DaDa Movement as part of WAIWAV with Dash Arts, Tate Plus Gallery, The Golden Thread Gallery Belfast.
