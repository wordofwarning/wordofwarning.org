Lauren Greer is a Northern Irish, working-class artist currently residing in Manchester. She is a theatre-maker, writer, collaborator, and creative learning practitioner; with a deep belief in the transformative power of the arts in being an educational tool, promoting wellbeing, connecting humans, and  upskilling young people. Whilst her performance work often evolves from a P/political stimulus, she is currently exploring the convergence of her identity with ritual and taboo.

**Noon-4pm** E.M. Parry · *Pricklings*          
         
*Pricklings* stages the artist's body as trans saint, queer icon, fetish object, witch's poppet, a luck charm, a ritual, a process, a test, a game.<br>It investigates trans embodiment and bodily autonomy, and pokes at the edges between self/other, flesh/costume, performer/spectator, artefact/event: remixing and repurposing religious, historical, artistic, medical, and magical iconography to create intimate spectacles and new rituals of becoming.          
         
E.M. Parry is a trans\*-disciplinary artist, designer, and performance-maker, working across scenography, drag, live & visual art, specialising in work which centres queer bodies and narratives. Flitting between genres and platforms, their work has been staged in the West End, international opera stages, pubs, clubs, cabarets, ships, lecture halls, and leaky basements. They work with, through, and for the queer body, squinting at history, flirting with ghosts and the things that go bump in the margins.
