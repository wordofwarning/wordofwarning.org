**Action Hero** · *A Western*         
         
*A Western* was first performed at Emergency in 2005 — it was the first performance Action Hero ever did and the tiny DIY show went on to be performed over 100 times all over the world, travelling to Rio De Janeiro, Bangkok, Tasmania, Madrid, Vienna, Texas, San Francisco, Vancouver, Brisbane, and many more. Last performed in 2016, this 30-minute version is being re-staged at Emergency 25 to celebrate Action Hero's 20 year anniversary.         
         
Gemma Paintin & James Stenhouse work under the moniker Action Hero. Together, they create artworks that explore what is it to be human now. James & Gemma's long-form, shape-shifting collaboration spans performance, installation, sound, events, and social practice. Since 2005, the work Action Hero has created has toured to more than 40 countries across 5 continents; from the smallest DIY and artist-led spaces to some of the world's most prestigious art institutions, galleries, festivals.

**Burt Turdgirth & special guests**         
         
A surreal journey into the underworld with drag king, anti-hero, and torch singer Burt Turdgirth, and his dog guides. Burt confronts his deepest fears and exposes his inner emotional life as an act of public service. His broken heart is the antidote to toxic masculinity. His mediocrity is your mediocrity; his shame is your shame. And you guessed it, his midlife crisis belongs to you. Please enjoy!         
         
*Whisper to Black* by Richard DeDomenici. Guest starring Martin Shead & Myshak Salansky.         
         
Burt is a torch singer and an epic fantasist. A Liverpool local phenomena, Burt has been seen at the Everyman Bistro, Quarry, Unity Theatre, on the runway at House of Suarez, at a kundalini retreat in Stolzenhagen (Germany), and a wedding in Rostanga (Sweden).

**Kellie Colbert & Deborah Newton** · *The Party We Didn't Plan*         
         
A playful exploration of life's messy, unplanned moments and milestones through the lens of a party gone awry. Two performers invite the audience into a fun but awkward celebration filled with confetti and confessions. Blending humour and vulnerability, this piece captures the experience of navigating unexpected loss, unmet expectations, and quiet resilience. Through play, partying, and friendship it celebrates survival over perfection, offering a bittersweet reflection on what it means to keep showing up when life doesn't go to plan.         
       
Kellie is a Greater Manchester-based performance maker. She would describe herself as an autobiographical artist, who creates work that is honest, relatable, and at times self-critical. She has collaborated with Eggs Collective, and has been commissioned by NIAMOS, Breakdown Bolton, Factory International, and most recently on her hÅb-commissioned solo: [*Dedicated To The One I Love*](/current/2025/colbert) which debuted at Contact in March.         
         
Deborah is the programme leader for BA (Hons) Theatre and Performance at The Arden School of Theatre. She is also a performance practitioner and facilitator specialising in contemporary performance with a strong commitment to making the arts accessible to all. Her work is often autobiographical, exploring themes of relationships, identity, and mental health.

**n:u (melissandre varin)** · *le monstre de mon papa*          
        
With *le monstre de mon papa* the monstrous reproduction of violence that happens in supremacist systems is subtly brought into question. Here the white lilies, white cotton, blue tarpaulin, and the artist's body invite attention to passed down violence. It is about imperial, monarchal, and patriarchal intimacies and their offshoots. Flirting with their inner inherited monster, n:u (melissandre varin) morphs into the haunting figure, the ghost of their father — that they are.         
         
n:u is an atmosphere-maker based in Birmingham. Working as an atmosphere-maker emerges from their Congolese sapeur heritage, and their practice as an environmental artist. They develop an ecologically care-full practice of receptivity, encounter, reciprocity, and transformation — creating performances, installations, sculptures, and liberatory infrastructures. Their practice invites different ways to be with change by blurring colonial lines between designers and participants, and making unexpected pairings between materials and concepts.

**Alexis Maxwell** · *The Space Between Us*         
         
A live spoken word performance with animated visuals, exploring what it means to be human through a speculative, sci-fi lens. Blending poetry and digital storytelling, it centres on non-human figures - Androids, Machines and Aliens - as metaphors for marginalised identities; weaving together personal reflections and cultural narratives to touch on the ways we navigate belonging, otherness and the shifting borders of identity.Alexis Maxwell is an interdisciplinary storyteller, self-taught animator and long-time fan of all things spoken word. They adopt a socially involved approach to exploring their lived experiences; using a blend of sound, projection and poetry to merge the digital and physical realms.                                                                                               <a href="https://sway.cloud.microsoft/D11WAgF2nucQnVAE" target="_blank">sway.cloud.microsoft/D11WAgF2nucQnVAE</a>

**Tom Cassani** · *Oraculum*

A divine announcement. A prophetic declaration. A reflective gathering. A reassembled mind reading act.Thanks to South House Faversham, Augusto Corrieri, Tim Bromage, Ocean Stefan, Thomas Wood, Lara Clifton, Screaming Alley and Nik Taylor.Tom Cassani is a UK based performance maker working with choreography, magic and live art. His performances draw on an expanded approach to magic examining the nature of deception and truth. Cassani's illusory texts, imagery and physicality reveal the mechanics of trickery ensuring we stay aware of our own role in experiencing something that is often not real.

**Elana Binysh** · *I think it was a feeling*

A performance experiment about self voyeurism, shame + sensation.  It’s also about pissing yourself: what it feels like when you can’t control it, and when you can. Elana will instruct you until you’re hyper aware of your body + bodies around you. You’ll be taught how to rub your fingers together, swallow + hide a wet patch.Set to a pulsing electronic soundtrack, I think it was a feeling is brash, noisy + tender. It asks you to let go of control—because maybe pissing yourself actually feels good. Lead Artist: Elana Binysh;  Sound Design: Naycha Somko;  Producer: Catherine Hoffmann; Support: Ged Boden Funded by Arts Council England  Elana Binysh is a live artist working across sound + performance. She creates sensory environments for audiences to give themselves over to + be swallowed up by. She likes to think about transgression, shame and grossness. <a href="https://www.elanabinysh.co.uk" target="_blank">www.elanabinysh.co.uk</a>CW: Mentions of medical trauma, bodily waste + kink practices

**Rachael Gooch** · *Mother Nature*

Compared with Mother Nature, we are insignificant. We are a single grain of sand on a vast beach. The world was turning before we were born and continues to turn long after we are dead. Mother Nature doesn't need us, but we need her. She generously sustains our existence but don't take for granted her brutality.Exploring motherhood, nature, and the strength, sacrifices and acts of servitude of women. How does the term Mother Nature reflect gender roles and societal expectations? How do our own life experiences shape our view on mothers? How do you know if you want to be a mother?Rachael Gooch is a North West based contemporary artist and theatre maker. She makes physical performances including solo and durational pieces and has performed at Word of Warning's Social Experiment. Her work explores human behaviour, voyeurism, parent/child dynamics, physical and vocal endurance, environment and natural cycles.CW: some flashes of light
