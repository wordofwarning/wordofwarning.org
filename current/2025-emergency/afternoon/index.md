Paula Davy is a solo live artist from a background of political activism & protest. Influenced by personal histories, biography, her own feelings of displacement, and strained family relationships, her practice could be described as Live Art happenings. Most of her works are informed by a biographical trilogy — *Paula The Slut*, *Paula The Disappointment*, *Paula The Depressive* — each celebrating a negative aspect of her history.
