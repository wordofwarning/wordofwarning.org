### Programme Notes              
Ground floor foyer · 20 min loop<br>**Rowena Gander · *Is this what it takes?***        
*"Is there an activity that makes you feel free? How many times did you repeat that activity before you felt a sense of freedom? What activities do you do on autopilot, and how many times did you have to do that thing before it became part of you? Watch me as I assemble, create with, and take down, a 70kg pole… 12 times in a row."*        
A durational + looping physical solo performance that asks audiences to consider the physical demands and/or mental bandwidth that 'empowering' activities require. It encourages audiences to think about the time and effort they put into looking or acting in a certain way to give the impression that they are in control. The performer exposes her own complex journey to empowerment as she repetitively assembles, creates with, and takes down a pole.        
As a dance theatre artist, **Rowena** creates thought-provoking solo performance works that question and negotiate themes of sexuality, power, and objectification in women. Since 2015 she's worked with stigmatised objects, the vertical pole and high heels, to tease out how they can add to or dissolve female subordination. She's performed internationally and nationally at festivals including Resolutions, Physical Fest, Innovations Platform, Secret Circus, Threshold Festival, Cirqadia, Leap Festival.

Space 1 lobby · 10 min loop<br>**Ayzmar · *What Is Mine?***        
A personal exploration into the colonisation of body mind and culture.<br>Shot + directed by Ramzia Jawara.        
**Ramzia** is an interdisciplinary artist, specialising in photography. Her artistic production is an intuitive and emotional response to her surroundings and worldly affairs. With a background in performance she sees the studio as a ground to play and connect with the subject — by bringing out qualities in a way that tells the story, emphasising visual dynamics. A lot of the work she creates is composed of personal experiences around identity, and observations surrounding current affairs concerning race, gender, and sexuality.

Space 2 · durational<br>**Simon Carroll-Jones & Wayne Steven Jackson**<br>***Re:Membering Manchester***        
*"In March 2020, the city of Manchester took a giant intake of breath, and since then it's been struggling to exhale. Locked down and paused, pieces of place were lost as music faded, activity stopped, and work ground to a halt. This multidisciplinary performance documents our collective attempts to pick up the pieces, to glue the city back together, to fix what has been broken. We want to re-member the city, and, in doing so, we want to remember why we're here."*<br>Original idea commissioned + supported by Tangled Feet Theatre.

Space 3 · 10 min loop, from 2.45pm<br>**Mitzee · *The Artist***        
A solo artwork, taking a candid look into the life of the iconic Mitzee.<br>A statuesque like figure, a living breathing artwork covered in white paint, sits on a draped piece of furniture. Still, very still. The audience applaud…<br>Mitzee, a Queer Artist, asks questions of originality, while the technology moulds her clay-like body into a recreation of a creation. But the question is — is Mitzee The Artist?        
Mitzee is an anti-drag alter-ego created by **Mark Powell**. He developed the character using inspiration from the queer scene in Liverpool — playing with gender normativity, switching the role from ‘male’ to ‘female’, and then to something that can only be described as ‘other’. Mitzee/Mark is unapologetically queer, parading in ten-inch platform heels, a glittered face, and an exposed hairy chest — provoking the audience and posing questions around gender, celebrity, and popular culture. Mark is studying for an MA in Contemporary Performance at MMU.

Space 4 · durational<br>**Kelvin Atmadibrata · *I Believe You!!***       
"I believe you!!" said we who stood by and did nothing as an execution took place.<br>Inspired by a memorable fake-execution scene from Squaresoft's 1997 JRPG Final Fantasy Tactics, *I Believe You!!* is staged as if it were child's play, with installation constructed from paper crafts and a boot-leg fashion doll. Within a general societal context, the work responds to the inability and hopelessness of a (caring) person with masculine privilege towards the unfairly pronounced guilty.         
**Kelvin** (b.1988, Jakarta, Indonesia) graduated with an MA in Contemporary Art Practice (Performance) from the Royal College of Art, now living and working between Jakarta + London. His works have been collected and presented at festivals and exhibitions in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Bangladesh, India, Australia, Europe & the U.S.A. He's the first recipient of Ivan Ladislav Galeta Prize (Croatia) for *Forcing Hyacinth*, seen at [Emergency 2019](/archive/2019-emergency/daytime).
