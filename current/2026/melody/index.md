Award-winning theatre maker and "Fringe legend" (Time Out), Victoria Melody joined a historical re-enactment society… because we all deal with divorce differently!          
          
Spending weekends as a Musketeer trying to get her head straight, she uncovered the story of a bunch of 17th-century radicals called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers" target="_blank">Diggers</a> — and everything changed.          
         
What started as a personal search for happiness turned into a quest to find the Diggers of today. She didn't expect to find them far from the battlefield, right on her doorstep.          
          
Blending storytelling and stand-up, past and present collide in this tale of high jinks and resistance.         
         
Directed by Mark Thomas, it celebrates the ordinary people still shaping history.

#### Artist        
Victoria is an award-winning British artist with a passion for other people's passions. Her work is rooted in playful, human-centred storytelling and combines meticulous research with on-the-ground community engagement, creating pieces that are accessible, witty, and deeply moving. She embeds herself in unique subcultures becoming an active participant in their rituals, then blends documentary techniques with theatrical performance to give a voice to these often-overlooked stories.         
         
She works in theatre, film, and stand-up comedy producing work on-stage, on-screen, in audio, and in the public realm. In the past she has become a pigeon racer, northern soul dancer, [championship dog handler](/archive/2014-spring/melody), beauty queen, funeral director, comedian, and skipper.         
         
Engaging with audiences who don't normally go to the theatre is at the forefront of what Victoria does. Her work merges the personal with the political and although it can tackle difficult subjects such as food poverty, death, neurodiversity, and impossible beauty standards it does so with care, creativity, tons of humour, and an ambition to make change.         
         
Known for her unique, immersive approach – living the life and learning the trade – Victoria brings real communities to the stage with warmth, humour, and heart. Her critically acclaimed shows blend documentary, comedy, and social commentary, making complex issues accessible, funny, and defiantly hopeful.
