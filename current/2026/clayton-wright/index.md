A tongue-in-cheek theatrical extravaganza, *Mr Blackpool* is an end of the pier show at the end of the world from multi-award winning theatre maker Harry Clayton-Wright…

<br>Set in the not too distant future against the decimated backdrop of climate collapse or late stage capitalism — you decide, could be both — four Blackpool performers embed the history of 'end of the pier' entertainment into a series of turns inspired by their lives and stories, the town's history, and modern politics. Through cabaret, magic, dance, and drag, this is cultural archaeology and satire at its campiest, presented in lurid technicolor and garish seaside spectacle.          
         
Remember your first time being led astray by a Liza Minnelli tribute act? Thought not. Been rugby tackled by stag and hen parties whilst dressed in a mascot costume on Blackpool's Golden Mile? Perhaps you just had a paper round? These are quotidian tales in the life of a Blackpool entertainer serving as inspiration for this bold new work.         
             
But who is this haunted impresario leading you through the night? What's beyond the feathers and rhinestones? The smiles covered in petroleum jelly? The sparkle and shine of the seafront? Don't worry about that, you're on holiday. The evening awaits you with *Mr Blackpool*.
