A tongue-in-cheek theatrical extravaganza, *Mr Blackpool* is an end of the pier show at the end of the world from multi-award winning theatre maker Harry Clayton-Wright…

<br>Set in the not too distant future against the decimated backdrop of climate collapse or late stage capitalism — you decide, could be both — four Blackpool performers embed the history of 'end of the pier' entertainment into a series of turns inspired by their lives and stories, the town's history, and modern politics. Through cabaret, magic, dance, and drag, this is cultural archaeology and satire at its campiest, presented in lurid technicolor and garish seaside spectacle.          
         
Remember your first time being led astray by a Liza Minnelli tribute act? Thought not. Been rugby tackled by stag and hen parties whilst dressed in a mascot costume on Blackpool's Golden Mile? Perhaps you just had a paper round? These are quotidian tales in the life of a Blackpool entertainer serving as inspiration for this bold new work.         
             
But who is this haunted impresario leading you through the night? What's beyond the feathers and rhinestones? The smiles covered in petroleum jelly? The sparkle and shine of the seafront? Don't worry about that, you're on holiday. The evening awaits you with *Mr Blackpool*.

#### Artist        
Harry is a critically acclaimed performance artist and award-winning theatre-maker and director from Blackpool with multiple international tours under his belt. He has worked with cabaret and circus ensembles, presented and produced theatre shows, created short films, published zines, crafted durational performances, and been a commissioned artist on LGBTQ+ heritage projects across the country. Harry has been an Associate Artist with Marlborough Productions since 2016 and was named one of British Council's Artists to Watch in 2019. *Sex Education*, his debut solo theatre show, won a Brighton Fringe award, was nominated for a Total Theatre award at the Edinburgh Fringe, toured the UK (including [Lowry with Word of Warning](/archive/2020-spring/clayton-wright)), and was part of the 2020 Sydney Mardi Gras programme.          
         
Harry made a small cameo appearance as Gaëtan Dugas (1952-1984), the man incorrectly named as ‘Patient Zero’, in the Channel 4 award-winning drama *It's a Sin* (2021). At the helm as Creative Director, he launched Queer Amusements in 2024, a brand new multi-artform festival taking place in Blackpool which returns in 2026. Harry directed the multi-award winning *No Apologies* by two-time Fringe First award-winner Emma Frankland which ran at Summerhall at the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2025. *We’re Still Here*, an LGBTQ+ heritage project based in Blackpool and founded by Harry and Blackpool artist Garth Gratrix, recently received £235k from The National Lottery Heritage Fund to produce two exhibitions about the town's queer history in 2027.
