### Artists + Activity (subject to change)                
**Chrissy Jones | *Shadow Girl***         
There once was a girl who was afraid of people. Every hurtful word they said chipped away a little bit more of her light… until *Shadow Girl* was born! An impish super hero, righting wrongs and making the world a little bit safer for everyone to be visible. A playful exploration of visibility and vulnerability and a stand against disability hate crime. Chrissy is a member of Proud & Loud Arts.<br>Performers: Chrissy Carol Jones + Darryl Duncan. Produced by Proud & Loud Arts.

**Emily Demetriou + Hector Dyer | *The Heat Beneath My Straw Feet***         
They’ve been standing in the fields for longer than anyone can remember, so what have scarecrows seen and what do they know is coming? The air tastes of chemicals, the trees are sick and there are no birds to scare away. If the scarecrows came to life, what message would they leave?

**Fun Science Bury/Rochdale | *Cloud building***        
Makeshift cloud-building machines cobbled together from water bottles, bungee ropes, dogfood dispensers, leaf blowers and hairdryers – come help our intrepid scientists fill the Z-arts atrium with giant clouds of bubbles. Build your very own mini device to take home with you. And look out – it might just start snowing bubbles…<br>Facilitators: Jacqueline Boylan + Aine O'Grady.

**Joe Stevens | *FLIGHT CLUB***

**Julie Burrow | *An Evening With Rosy Maple***           
Rosy Maple, the hardest working moth in Tinseltown, spills the beans on her glittering showbiz career. This sassy, bug-eyed starlet of yesteryear regales lucky audiences with half-remembered tales and semi-settled grudges. There’ll be a half-eaten costume, a six-legged dance, and rapturous applause (by any means necessary).

**Lady Helena Vortex + Mx Lucille Power | *Balloon-a-rama (Give us your Breath)***         
Do you like balloons? Ever wondered what to do with all of the carbon-dioxide you breathe out every day? Lady Helena Vortex and Mx Lucille Power can help. You see, their costumes are made from balloons. But they can't do it all on their own, and they need your help to blow up these balloons – can you give them your breath?<br>Join them to breathe out, let off steam, and help them transform their costumes into a kaleidoscopic vision of gifted carbon dioxide. You'll leave feeling lighter, maybe a bit sillier (balloons can do that), and you might even get a balloon to take home with you…<br>Lady Helena Vortex and Mx Lucille Power create dynamic, humorous, theatrical live art works that question value systems and hierarchies.

**Monsur Mansoor | *NOTHING 2 NOBODY***           
Bollywood sound-score meets swirling silks and a unique hoover dance – this is a dance ritual to banish despair through pleasure.

**Powder Keg | *Today we truant, today we strike***           
On Friday 15 February 2019, students from schools across England took part in a school strike to protest the government's lack of action on climate change. This proactive demand for government accountability was dismissed as 'truanting'. *Today we truant, today we strike* is a response to that reaction: a celebration of what we stand for, and a dress rehearsal protest for future generations. Pop into to make a sign/placard and then join us at 2.45pm as we march through Z-arts. Demand the future.<br>Facilitators: Jake Walton, Josh Coates + Ross McCaffrey
