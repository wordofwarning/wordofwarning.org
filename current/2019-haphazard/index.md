### Saturday 27 April 2019, 12noon-3pm. FREE             
**Turn up at any time, come and go as you please, and expect the unexpected…** Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around Hulme's historic Z-arts building.

*A bubbling symphony of a day — clouds of foam and a balloon-dance in reverse. Pop away your hang-ups, create a magical tree of fantasy creatures or play a game of high-flying paper stakes. Playful shadows, scarecrows with a conscience, a signing musical statue, and the hardest working moth in Tinseltown.*
