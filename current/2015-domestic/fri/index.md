####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**Rachel Sweeney | *Driftlines*** (video programme, ongoing from 7pm)        
This short dance film explores sense and synapses within a delicate ecology of rock, water, salt and skin. *Driftlines* follows a series of shifting perspectives held by both camera and dancer, captured along the Copper Coast shingle stretches of south east Ireland. Here, the camera follows a dancer's physical immersion and tactile exploration of those arterial spaces that are left in the wake of coastal erosion. The movement and environmental sounds fuse with internalized sensations to create a kinesthetic experience moving from water to land.

**Peter Grist + Company | *M.E.N.***        
Drawing upon an idea contained within the Greek myth *Pygmalion* — a tale about a sculptor who falls in love with a female statue of his own creation, an exploration of narcissism in relationships. The work revolves around a male duet performed in a marked-out space. So what are we to do? How do we protect ourselves from narcissists if they're so adept at slipping into our lives unnoticed?

**Joshua Hubbard | *Monochrome to colour***           
This solo is two ideas merged together, focusing on the idea of transformation through visually striking imagery and highly physical movement.

**Sophie Unwin | *The Chronicles Of Joy***         
*The Chronicles Of Joy* takes all the manuals, mantras and You Tube tutorials about happiness and throws them out of the
window. Because you are not alone, she is not happier than you are and you were better off without him anyway. Rule number 1, say yes.

**Rachel Sweeney | *Tradewinds/Taste of China***        
This solo is informed by the composite metamorphosis from rock to liquid mass, and employs a minimalist Butoh movement aesthetic. The title reflects the spatial arrangement for this work and is based upon the old mining process of changing composite granite into china clay.

**Lo-Giudice Dance | *The Teeth Behind The Kisses***        
Inspired by time spent with artist Hector De Gregorio and his study on the theme of 'Ecstasy', two performers take to the stage to capture themes of the Divine and terrestrial, quiet and rapturous, extreme love and extreme pain. The work combines modern art and classical design to reveal religious overtones and eroticism.
