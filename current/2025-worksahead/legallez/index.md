*Presented by* Word of Warning *+* Contact *in* [Works Ahead 2025](/current/2025-worksahead): *a double bill of new works-in-development from Adèle and [Martha Pailing](/current/2025-worksahead/pailing)*        
        
***Landings***         
            
A missing church on Orkney.<br>An only child in Oldham.<br>A relief for those in free-fall, and a retreat for those in crisis.         
         
Live sound experiment, demonstration, and storytelling.          
         
#### Artist         
Adèle is a Manchester-based writer, sound-artist, and performer. Their solo work — exploring themes such as capitalism, religion, and dreams — has taken the form of short-stories, soundscapes, poetry, and installations.         
         
Before making solo work, Adèle co-founded MOUTH, a Bristol based dance-theatre duo. They created and toured *Mouth* (2017) before being commissioned by Arts Council England, in support with Creative Youth Network, to create *Skin* (2018) and *Teeth* (2019). With mentorship from CYN and becoming Ferment Artists through Bristol Old Vic’s Artist Development Programme, MOUTH toured to multiple venues in Bristol during their years as a company.         
         
They co-produced *Nothing* (2018) by Lulu Raczka in collaboration with A Room Full Of People Present. Most recently they performed in *Sunday Morning* (2023) by Josh Coates at Liverpool's Unity Theatre and online at HOME — a walking tour of the internet that takes you through the history of trespass and how we now occupy the digital space. Adèle debuted *Mortar* (2022-2024), their soundstory performance, at [Emergency 24](/archive/2024-emergency/evening) and Camden People's Theatre — researching burnout in our capitalist world, telling the story of the man upstairs who gave his all.
