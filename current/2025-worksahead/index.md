#### About           
Each year since 2012, [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) has invited artists to dig deeper into work presented at the previous year’s [Emergency](/hab/emergency) (or occasionally at other events). Our thirteenth edition is a double bill from two solo artists: Adèle Le Gallez and Martha Pailing.         
        
A project developed out of the old Method Lab & SeedFund schemes which [hÅb](/hab) ran with greenroom until 2011, over the past fourteen years [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) has offered 36 small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists — often in partnership with <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>.         
         
#### Credits         
[Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) 2025 produced by [hÅb](/hab); supported by <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> and using public funding by Arts Council England.<br>Project Mentor: Peader Kirk
