#### Works        
***UNTITLED* by Adèle Le Gallez**         
         
In 1942, a church appears in the centre of Orkney: lifting, ringing loud above all the other noises, not taken in for more than a few seconds, red-hot by the feel.         
         
The same year, 528.9 miles away in Oldham: a woman who had always had faith in the tangible things in life found a new kind of faith.<br>That one decision she made, changed the trajectory of her family tree…         
         
Adèle is a writer, sound-artist, and performer.         
         
***Failure To Thrive* by Martha Pailing**         
          
*"Touch is the first sensory system to develop in the foetus."*         
          
What does it mean to be held, to be nurtured, to be known?<br>Part-story, part-discovery, part-surrender: an investigation into touch and regression.<br>
This work unpacks the strange contradiction of being a fully grown adult who is still learning how to 'thrive'.         
        
Martha is a northern-born spoken word and performance artist.

#### About
