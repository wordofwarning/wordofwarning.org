**the institute for crazy dancing** · *FRAGILE. One way to wonderment…*         
         
A colourful cube transforms into a see-saw and a striking Hazard Cube.<br>*Feeling fragile? Get a sticker; find your balance; make a wish and enter wonderment…*         
         
*THIS PARA READS LIKE DESCRIPTION, NOT COPY?<br>Participants approach us and ask what's going on. We engage in conversation about fragility. Up to four participants at a time then get a FR/AGILE sticker and find balance on the see-saw. Following the balance we unzip the 2m cube and invite the participants inside: "Close your eyes and make a wish". Then we count down from ten before tilting the cube on its axis to release them to a new view of the world.*         
         
The ICD has been crafting participatory performance art for 25 years. From cross-city masquerades to installations that look like fairground rides — but do all the opposites; absurdist cabaret to art gallery interventions and site-responsive performance.

**Madame Zucchini** · *Hot Political Potato Gameshow*         
         
*Come and see the veg characters Mme Z has created — could Nigel Cabbage be there? What about Tayto Swift? Do you want to throw potatoes at them in her Veg Shy, reminiscent of fetes with a dash of the horticultural show? Do you want to create your own character to add to the lineup? Feel free to take your creation with you.*

**Shannon Mulvey** · *FRANKENDIVA!*         
         
A glorious, glitter-soaked monster of a show, *FRANKENDIVA!* is stomping back — bigger, bolder, and even more unapologetically fabulous. 💥🧷💋         
         
Part pop party, part power anthem, this high-energy, interactive performance is inspired by Frankenstein — but instead of creating a monster, we're building a DIVA. With the help of the audience, piece by piece, she comes to life in all her fierce, messy glory. Expect iconic pop, franken-glam aesthetics, and a wild celebration of individuality, empowerment, and rejecting society's expectations.        

**At 3.30pm**, join us for the *FRANKENDIVA! DISCO* — a full-throttle, all-in, stomp-it-out dance party where everyone gets up to unleash their inner diva. 💃⚡️ Let's build a diva. Together. One stomp at a time. 💄🩹         
         
Shannon is a performer & lecturer with extensive national and international experience.
