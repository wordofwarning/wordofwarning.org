**the institute for crazy dancing** · *FRAGILE. One way to wonderment…*         
         
A colourful one metre cube transforms into a see-saw and a striking two metre Hazard Cube.<br>*Participants approach us and ask what's going on. We engage in conversation about fragility. Up to four participants at a time then get a FR/AGILE sticker and find balance on the see-saw. Following the balance we unzip the 2m cube and invite the participants inside: "Close your eyes and make a wish". Then we count down from ten before tilting the cube on its axis to release them to a new view of the world.*         
         
The ICD has been crafting participatory performance art for 25 years. From cross-city masquerades to installations that look like fairground rides — but do all the opposites; absurdist cabaret to art gallery interventions and site-responsive performance.

A glorious, glitter-soaked monster of a show, FRANKENDIVA! is stomping back—bigger, bolder, and even more unapologetically fabulous. 💥🧷💋

Part pop party, part power anthem, this high-energy, interactive performance is inspired by Frankenstein—but instead of creating a monster, we’re building a DIVA. With the help of the audience, piece by piece, she comes to life in all her fierce, messy glory. Expect iconic pop, franken-glam aesthetics, and a wild celebration of individuality, empowerment, and rejecting society’s expectations.

At 15:30, join us for the FRANKENDIVA! DISCO—a full-throttle, all-in, stomp-it-out dance party where everyone gets up to unleash their inner diva.💃⚡️

Let’s build a diva. Together. One stomp at a time. 💄🩹
