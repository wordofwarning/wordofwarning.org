This eleventh edition takes place at new home <a href="https://companychameleon.com" target="_blank">Company Chameleon</a> Studios, and this time things will be a little different as we plan to use just the one studio; get a feel for it with [2023's programme](/archive/2023-turn/programme) & [gallery of images](/galleries/2013-turn).<br>*NB Friday's public platform is followed by an artist day for participants only.*        
        
Greater Manchester's open call dance platform, [Turn](/hab/turn) aims to be:<br>— a public micro-festival and open submission platform;<br>— an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work;<br>— an artist networking event;<br>— a selection event for the Turn Prize commission (returning in 2024).         
        
Fluidly lyrical, effervescently acrobatic, or eccentrically innovative, let Turn 2024 transport you into a frenzy of dance…
