#### About         
**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' Live Art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around and about the historic <a href="https://z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: a free afternoon of Live Art for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!            

        
We were calling for proposals for our sixth free 'all ages' Live Art day, taking place on **Saturday 22 July, Noon-3pm** in and around <a href="https://z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a>.          
        
This is not Live Art for children, but Live Art for ALL AGES — and we mean from tot to timeworn, 8 months to 80 years — so work should have appeal for adults and children alike (even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!)        
        
From experience, what works best are big surreal images, interesting repetitive movement, and nothing too text heavy. We have access to a number of spaces within Z-arts, and work immediately outside the building may also be possible. Durational, intervention, and 'come and go' work seems to work the best — we're not really looking for sit-down theatre shows.        
     

To date, Haphazard has seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; a singing fish and a sax-playing bear; paintball golf and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet, and a tiny bee-shaped world… Have a look at the [2013](/galleries//2013-haphazard), [2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard), [2016](/galleries/2016-haphazard), [2017](/galleries/2017-haphazard), [2019](/galleries/2019-haphazard) image galleries, and [2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard), [2015](/archive/2015-haphazard), [2016](/archive/2016-haphazard), [2017](/archive/2017-haphazard), [2019](/archive/2019-haphazard) archives to get an idea of what's gone before.
