**Turn up at any time, come and go as you please, and expect the unexpected…** Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around Hulme's historic Z-arts building. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out.<br>To get a feel for it, have a look at some [artist images](/galleries/2019-haphazardpre) + read the [programme notes](/archive/2019-haphazard/programme); now that it's over, see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2019-haphazard) from the day.                 

*A bubbling symphony of a day — clouds of foam and a balloon-dance in reverse. Pop away your hang-ups, create a magical tree of fantasy creatures or play a game of high-flying paper stakes. Playful shadows, scarecrows with a conscience, a signing musical statue, and the hardest working moth in Tinseltown.*
