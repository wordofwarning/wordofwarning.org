*Lasers firing, slinkies dancing, book-learned mime, and a shower of confetti.<br>A flock of birds — scoundrels of the sky, laying woollen eggs, making dreams come true.<br>A bold pink giant spinning jellyfish.<br>One small nibble for mouse, one giant bite for micekind.<br>Magical bananas and a micro(wave) puppet show.<br>A nice big tower held together with cream.<br>Touch, mess, and play with everything — things are popping…*

#### About         
[Haphazard](/hab/haphazard) is our occasional foray into 'all ages' Live Art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around and about Hulme's historic <a href="https://www.z-arts.org/about-us" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building.         
         
After a four-year hiatus, this sixth edition presents fourteen works — previous editions have seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; a singing fish and a sax-playing bear; paintball golf and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet, and a tiny bee-shaped world…
