*Presented by* Word of Warning *+* Z-arts           
         
**Turn up at any time, come and go as you please, and expect the unexpected…** Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around Hulme's historic Z-arts building. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out.<br>To get a feel for it, have a look at some [artist images](/galleries/2019-haphazardpre) + read the [programme notes](/archive/2019-haphazard/programme); now that it's over, see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2019-haphazard) from the day.                 
Our annual whirlwind of new dance returns: fourteen works take over Z-arts for one extraordinary night on **Saturday 22 July from Noon to 3pm**.        
        
*Lasers firing, slinkies dancing, book-learned mime, and a shower of confetti.<br>A flock of birds: scoundrels of the sky, laying woollen eggs, making dreams come true.<br>A bold, pink, giant spinning jellyfish. One small nibble for mouse, one giant bite for micekind.<br>Magical bananas and a micro(wave) puppet show. A nice big tower held together with cream.<br>Touch, mess, and play with everything — things are popping…*
