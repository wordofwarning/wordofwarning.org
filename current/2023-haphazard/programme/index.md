Gemma Lees · *Making Sense*

An immersive sensory experience where you have permission to touch, mess, and play with everything. Initially conceived for neurodiverse folks, this is an inclusive space for all.
Dig up dinosaurs in the sand with tiny shovels, sit in a dark tent and play with lights & projections, jazz-up slime to take home, play with scented play dough, spin one of fifty fidget spinners on the board, or take a moment to mindfully draw and colour — there’s something for everyone!

Gemma is a Romany Gypsy, disabled, and neurodiverse artist, poet, actor, facilitator, and theatre-maker from Bury. Her work often deals with her lived experiences of mental illness, homelessness, physical disability, neurodivergence, and the contemporary Romany experience. A core team member of Girl Gang Manchester, she has worked with Graeae, Triple C, British Art Show, BBC Radio Manchester, amongst others.
