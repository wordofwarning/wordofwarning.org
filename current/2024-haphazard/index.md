#### About         
[Haphazard](/hab/haphazard) is our frequent foray into 'all ages' Live Art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around and about Hulme's historic <a href="https://www.z-arts.org/about-us" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building.         
         
This seventh edition will present *about* ten works — we've previously seen ping pong balls & squeaky toys; singing fish & a sax-playing bear; paintball golf & human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet, and a tiny bee-shaped world…
