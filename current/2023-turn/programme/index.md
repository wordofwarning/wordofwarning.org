Christian Asare · *Diasporic Identity — an Exploration*         
        
My tone, my vocabulary, my gait, my orientation — does it make me British? Ghanaian? Or something other?<br>Doing my traditional dance in traditional robes and European medieval armament, would I feel like a Ghanaian Brit — channelling something ancient and intrinsic? Or a British Ghanaian — trying my hand at something I don’t really know? This performance explores the intersection of the various cultural influences that form my diasporic identity.
