Christian Asare · *Diasporic Identity — an Exploration*         
         
*What & where exactly is "the line"? What makes me so "other" to others of my Kin, and yet again "othered" in British Culture, as African Diaspora? Where do I stop being British & start being Ghanaian, and vice versa? Is it in physical manifestation of gait or posture — subtleties in elocution, grammar, or pronunciation across dialects? Is it defined in nuances of gesture or tone?*<br>A uniquely interdisciplinary exposition of the conflicting duality of diasporic identity.        
        
Christian Asare is a practising fine artist with a focus on afro-futurism & installation. He is also a dancer & choreographer working across theatre, Live Art, modern dance. His work is reflective of an eclectic transatlantic education, pulling influence & inspiration from variations in language & cross-cultural heritage.

Jack Evans · *Symbolic Communcation*        
*I want to showcase how my movement represents the words I want to speak, using BSL to inform the different emotions I will re-enact as part of my movement in response to the conscious body. The aim is to create a barrier to over-thinking, which prevents me from communicating through fear of judgement, backlash, and rejection. By re-enacting these fears I gain courage to retaliate and become free. I want to show & raise awareness of the reality I face as someone with Asperger's syndrome.*         
         
Jack Evans is a dance artist with Asperger's syndrome whose interest is in choreographing screendance projects as well as solo performances in his own or others' choreographies. He specialises in combining body popping & with more conceptual movement of contemporary dance.
