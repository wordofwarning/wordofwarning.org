Christian Asare · *Diasporic Identity — an Exploration*         
         
*What & where exactly is "the line"? What makes me so "other" to others of my Kin, and yet again "othered" in British Culture, as African Diaspora? Where do I stop being British & start being Ghanaian, and vice versa? Is it in physical manifestation of gait or posture — subtleties in elocution, grammar, or pronunciation across dialects? Is it defined in nuances of gesture or tone?*<br>A uniquely interdisciplinary exposition of the conflicting duality of diasporic identity.        
        
Christian Asare is a practising fine artist with a focus on afro-futurism & installation. He is also a dancer & choreographer working across theatre, Live Art, modern dance. His work is reflective of an eclectic transatlantic education, pulling influence & inspiration from variations in language & cross-cultural heritage.

Jack Evans · *Symbolic Communcation*        
        
*I want to showcase how my movement represents the words I want to speak, using BSL to inform the different emotions I will re-enact as part of my movement in response to the conscious body. The aim is to create a barrier to over-thinking, which prevents me from communicating through fear of judgement, backlash, and rejection. By re-enacting these fears I gain courage to retaliate and become free. I want to show & raise awareness of the reality I face as someone with Asperger's syndrome.*         
         
Jack Evans is a dance artist with Asperger's syndrome whose interest is in choreographing screendance projects as well as solo performances in his own or others' choreographies. He specialises in combining body popping & with more conceptual movement of contemporary dance.

James Hewison and Company · *Hard Wired*        
         
*Hard Wired for what? Men & dance, balls & ballrooms!*<br>Referencing Warrington's industrial heritage of wire production and the nickname of its Rugby League team, this choreographic project is made by the performers, all of whom live in or were born & raised in the town. It draws on personal narrative & memories to explore the impact of birthplace & culture on their artistic journeys, while also playing with stereotypical views on working-class masculinity.         
         
Made & performed by Ryan Atherton, Sam Brown, Robbie Garland, James Hewison<br>James Hewison has worked nationally & internationally since 1991. Co-founder & Associate Artistic Director of Vtol Dance Co, with extensive choreographic credits for Volcano Theatre Company & Senior Lecturer in Dance at Edge Hill University.         
<hr>         
Lizzy Owen · *The Unheard*        
         
Taking Samuel Beckett's *Not, I* as a stimulus to create sound & movement, this piece aims to amplify the desperation of needing to be heard while only being seen. The female voice is present but not acknowledged or understood. Looking at the relationships between performer & watcher, performer & auditor, the aim of the work is to bridge the gap between the unseen hierarchy of performer & audience, as well as creating a feeling of the uncomfortable.         
         
Lizzy Owen is a Trinity Laban Conservatoire graduate, studying for a Masters in Choreography at the University of Salford.

Maisha Kungu Dance · *HEARTH*        
         
*A love letter to Manchester. Devised & diverse, together we move through the terrain of the body within the landscape of the city. This is an introduction to my world, via my community whose beginnings may be elsewhere, but now call Manchester home.*<br>Five dancers take you on a journey, celebrating differences, creating new cultures while connecting Manchester to its industrial, global, and colonial past to protest, and re-humanise migration as an innate form of human movement.         
         
Made with & peformed by Nigel Beard, Tan Ire, Jesus Blancos-Santos, Yosha Gilkes, Jova Bagioli Reyes<br>Maisha Kungu is a multidisciplinary dance artist & researcher in ethnography & cultural theory.

Matrafisc Dance Company · *One Plus One Equals One*         
         
*Are you the clothes you wearing?*         
         
Choreographer & dancers: Anthony Apicella & Ina Colizza · Music by Trentemoller<br>Matrafisc Dance was established in 2015 by Manchester-based Italian choreographers Antonello Apicella & Ina Colizza, to research & express their artistic & training differences in a new choreographic language, creating exciting & unique repertoire.         
<hr>         
Matter of Fact · *Cocktails*         
        
*How safe can women feel walking home anymore? Is it better to stay as a group & grip your keys, or wear baggy clothes, cut your hair short, and not make eye contact? When does violence against women stop being a feminist issue and start being a human rights emergency?*<br>Through the use of nostalgic music & storytelling through movement, *Cocktails* follows the journey of two young women making their way home after a night out to explore how we make the night less threatening.<br>Supported by Company Chameleon & Culture Warrington.         
         
Matter of Fact is a collaboration between performer/choreographer/facilitators Erin Pollitt & Daisy Howell to make their own work focusing on feminism & popular culture.
