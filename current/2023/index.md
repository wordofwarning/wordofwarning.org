#### About         
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy, and to also introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond, including livestreams and more online…          
>*If you haven’t attended one of these performance evenings yet, WTF are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that's out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews on WTF Wednesdays (November 2019)</a>        
      
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. Over the past eleven years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Ron Athey, Harry Clayton-Wright, Chanje Kunda, Stacy Makishi, Pinchbeck & Smith, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater, and Proud & Loud Arts (amongst others).

#### Audiences         
We don't want to put you off by talking art form labels — yes, there'll be theatre, Live Art, performance, dance, etc. — as our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So, if you like comedy, music, gaming, or want a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on…         
>*Astonishing. Like nothing else. Transformative, immersive, moving.*<br>*Always special, bringing the unexpected and intriguing, thank you.*<br>*Fabulous for seeing things different from the mainstream machine.<br>Really important and interesting work, different to everything else.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience feedback

#### People        
Tamsin Drury, hÅb's Director, has been around a while — a really long while — she's been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape, and firing a glitter-cannon to the *Hallelujah* chorus! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has worked with hundreds of NW artists to help them create new work. Please send programming enquiries to her via <mailto:info@habmcr.org>        
        
John Franklin-Johnston, hÅb's Programme Manager, is a freelance producer, events manager, facilitator, and was <a href="http://greenroomarts.org" target="_blank">greenroom</a>'s programme co-ordinator.         
         
Peader Kirk, artist + mentor, supports [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) and other hÅb projects.
