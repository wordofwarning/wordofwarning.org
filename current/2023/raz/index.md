#### About         
***tbd*** *Dead Cats* blends new writing, performance, film-making, and an obvious plant, to show — not tell — the truths behind the fictions.        
          
#### Artist        
***tbd*** A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject, and medium. Since 1997 they've made work and supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US, and Zimbabwe.         
        
Their *Truth to Power Project* has lifted the veil on The Secret State (*A Machine they're Secretly Building* — in [Spring17](/archive/2017-spring/proto-type)), shown how collective power can move a mountain (*The Audit (or Iceland, a modern myth)* — in [Spring18](/archive/2018-springsummer/proto-type)), and includes a radio drama with the BBC (*The Forgotten Suffragette*).
