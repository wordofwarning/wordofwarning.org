#### About         
*Unnatural Cycles — A Ghost Story* emerged from a dream in which Avital met her Grandmother, followed by a year of listening to old cassettes in which she was interviewed about her experiences surviving the Jewish Holocaust.         
          
Drawing on personal experiences to be told in song, live-looped audio, and film, *Unnatural Cycles* holds the weight of present and generational trauma in the body of a woman reckoning with inherited pain and the desire to bear a child.        
          
#### Artist        
Jerusalem-born singer-songwriter Avital Raz has made a name for herself singing politically engaging, strikingly original, and fearless songs — to emerge as a distinctive and truly individual voice that speaks with a very real and potent self-expression.         
          
Avital studied at Jerusalem's School of Visual Theatre, before embarking on a 20-year career as a singer-songwriter and musician. After completing degrees in Western Classical singing + composition in Jerusalem, she relocated to Varanasi (India) to study the sacred art of Dhrupad singing for six years under Professor Ritwik Sanyal. She's released seven albums of her own music, and performed with acclaimed world music band Rafiki Jazz for three years.         
         
Her first solo theatre show [*My Jerusalem*](/archive/2019-worksahead/raz) — a politically charged tale derived from a song — was commissioned by [hÅb](/hab) + <a href="https://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> for [Works Ahead 2019](/archive/2019-worksahead); an accompanying feature-length documentary *Your Jerusalem* was commissioned by Journeys Festival International + created with Chris Davis in 2020.
