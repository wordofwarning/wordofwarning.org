#### About         
>In this room, or in rooms like this room, they use phrases like "collateral damage", like "extraordinary rendition", like "perception management".<br>They cover up their dirty words with clean ones, in rooms like this room.<br>In rooms like this room, they redact the names.<br>In rooms like this room, language is laundered.<br>The name of the game is spin.        

*Dead Cats* blends new writing, performance, film-making, and an obvious plant, to show — not tell — the truths behind the fictions.        
          
Part three of Proto-type's critically-acclaimed *Truth to Power Project*: a socially-engaged exploration of power, democracy, truth-telling, protest, privacy, conspiracy, and control that began as a response to the UK political climate in 2015 — it has since manifested as a wealth of creative, cultural, and participatory activity that seeks to shed light on the complex, hidden systems that govern how we live our lives.        
            
**Below you can also watch *A Dangerous Thing*** — their new, digitally animated work created in response to a world full of uncertainty.<br>It wants to punch its way out of the screen and into our homes.<br>It wants to shake us up, to wake us up, and to hunt down all those insidious lies, hiding in plain sight, that run ahead of us with their boots on.<br>It's coming, and it cannot be stopped…

#### Artists        
A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject, and medium. Since 1997 they've made work and supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US, and Zimbabwe.         
        
Their *Truth to Power Project* has lifted the veil on The Secret State (*A Machine they're Secretly Building* — in [Spring17](/archive/2017-spring/proto-type)), shown how collective power can move a mountain (*The Audit (or Iceland, a modern myth)* — in [Spring18](/archive/2018-springsummer/proto-type)), and includes a radio drama with the BBC (*The Forgotten Suffragette*).       
         
They've also made a multimedia opera featuring a live laptop orchestra (*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* — in [Spring14](/archive/2014-spring/prototype)) and a two-week theatre and pervasive technology experience (*Fortnight*).
