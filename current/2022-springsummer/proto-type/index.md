#### About         
>*There's a shadow coming, across the sea. Long and terrifying. The vultures are circling, the wolves are howling… how can we weather this storm?*        

The global economy is a mess. The crash has landed, the tide's swept out, and it's taken our hope with it. There's less in our pockets and more to be spent. The rich have got richer, the middle's squeezed tight, and the poor are being dragged ever downwards. With the true value of money and the human cost of greed firmly in their sights, Proto-type Theater tell the story of how a nation raised their voices in protest.                   
           
Using original text, performance, film, music and animation, *The Audit* is about finding strength, overcoming a world designed to keep us docile, and how collective power can move a mountain — even if only a little.           
         
#### Artists        
A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject and medium. Alongside lifting the veil on the Secret State in their first theatrical examination of contemporary politics (*A Machine they're Secretly Building* — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2017](/archive/2017-spring/proto-type)), this has included a two-week long theatrical experience using pervasive technologies (*Fortnight*), a multimedia concert-performance featuring animation and live laptop orchestra (*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2014](/archive/2014-spring/prototype)), and a radio drama with the BBC.        
        
Since 1997 they've made work and supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US + Zimbabwe: founded in New York City by Peter S. Petralia (1997-2006), relocating to Lancaster's Storey Institute (2006-10), then Manchester's Northern Quarter (2010-14), and now Lincoln's Cathedral Quarter, they make and support work across the region.            
          
#### Reviews         
>*Cracking intelligent, funny, new political theatre.<br>Terrifying,  overwhelming – a total highlight.*<br>Audience Feedback on work-in-progress of *The Audit*          
>*…this smartly intelligent hour-long whizz through the world of surveillance, and the way governments legitimise spying on their citizens, makes you question what we mean by a terrorist and where the real threat lies.*<br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/27/a-machine-theyre-secretly-building-review-surveillance" target="_blank">★★★★ Lyn Gardner, The Guardian on *A Machine…*</a>.

#### WTFWednesday         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
