*Dead Cats* blends new writing, performance, film-making, and an obvious plant, to show — not tell — the truths behind the fictions.        
          
Part three of Proto-type's critically-acclaimed *Truth to Power Project*: a socially-engaged exploration of power, democracy, truth-telling, protest, privacy, conspiracy, and control.<br>Beginning in 2015 as a response to the UK political climate, it has since manifested as a wealth of creative, cultural, and participatory activity that seeks to shed light on the complex, hidden systems that govern how we live our lives.        
         
#### Artists        
A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject, and medium. Since 1997 they've made work + supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US, and Zimbabwe.         
        
Their *Truth to Power Project* includes a radio drama with the BBC (*The Forgotten Suffragette*), lifted the veil on The Secret State (*A Machine they're Secretly Building* — in [Spring17](/archive/2017-spring/proto-type)), and showed how collective power can move a mountain (*The Audit* — in [Spring18](/archive/2018-springsummer/proto-type)).       
         
They've also made a two-week theatre + pervasive technology experience (*Fortnight*) and a multimedia opera featuring a live laptop orchestra (*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* — in [Spring14](/archive/2014-spring/prototype)).

>*Cracking intelligent, funny, new political theatre.<br>Terrifying, overwhelming — a total highlight.*<br>Audience Feedback on work-in-progress of *The Audit*          
>*…this smartly intelligent hour-long whizz through the world of surveillance, and the way governments legitimise spying on their citizens, makes you question what we mean by a terrorist and where the real threat lies.*<br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/27/a-machine-theyre-secretly-building-review-surveillance" target="_blank">★★★★ Lyn Gardner, The Guardian on *A Machine…*</a>.
