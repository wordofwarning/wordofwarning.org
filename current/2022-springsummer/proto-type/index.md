#### About         
In this room, or in rooms like this room, they use phrases like "collateral damage", like "extraordinary rendition", like "perception management".<br>They cover up their dirty words with clean ones, in rooms like this room.<br>In rooms like this room, they redact the names.<br>In rooms like this room, language is laundered.<br>The name of the game is spin.        

*Dead Cats* blends new writing, performance, film-making, and an obvious plant, to show — not tell — the truths behind the fictions.<br>It is the third work in Proto-type's critically acclaimed *Truth to Power Project* — a socially-engaged exploration of power, democracy, truth-telling, protest, privacy, conspiracy, and control.         
         
#### Artists        
A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject and medium. Alongside lifting the veil on the Secret State in their first theatrical examination of contemporary politics (*A Machine they're Secretly Building* ADD IN *The Audit* COPY — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2017](/archive/2017-spring/proto-type)) and [Spring 2018](/archive/2018-springsummer/proto-type). They've also made a two-week long theatrical experience using pervasive technologies (*Fortnight*), a multimedia concert-performance featuring animation and live laptop orchestra (*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2014](/archive/2014-spring/prototype)), and a radio drama with the BBC.        
       
Since 1997 they've made work and supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US + Zimbabwe: founded in New York City by Peter S. Petralia (1997-2006), relocating to Lancaster's Storey Institute (2006-10), then Manchester's Northern Quarter (2010-14), and now Lincoln's Cathedral Quarter, they make and support work across the region.            
          
#### Reviews         
Praise for Proto-type's Truth to Power Project, including A Machine they’re Secretly Building &amp; The Audit (or Iceland, a modern myth):
“This is coolly reasoned theatre, produced by Proto-type Theater with stylish aplomb.” — Lyn Gardner, The Guardian
“Proto-type’s team have such imagination and clarity of vision… a great antidote to [a] tangled political landscape” — Exeunt
“It made me want to headbutt a bank.” — Audience Response        

>*Cracking intelligent, funny, new political theatre.<br>Terrifying,  overwhelming – a total highlight.*<br>Audience Feedback on work-in-progress of *The Audit*          
>*…this smartly intelligent hour-long whizz through the world of surveillance, and the way governments legitimise spying on their citizens, makes you question what we mean by a terrorist and where the real threat lies.*<br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/27/a-machine-theyre-secretly-building-review-surveillance" target="_blank">★★★★ Lyn Gardner, The Guardian on *A Machine…*</a>.
