*Presented by* The Lowry + Word of Warning *as a* <a href="https://thelowry.com/wtf-wednesday" target="_blank">WTF</a>         
         
*HIGH STEAKS* is a show about labia, labia-shaming, cosmetic surgery, and fundamentally, body lovin'.          
          
Award-winning, queer performer, ELOINA, hangs two beef steaks from her labia, butchers them up, and sizzles them on a grill.           
          
And…her mum is in the show.

#### About         
Seamlessly melding performance art and comedy clowning, *HIGH STEAKS* discusses rising demands in young people for labiaplasty — plastic surgery to make the labia smaller/more symmetrical.         
         
Through live conversations with her mum and recorded interviews with labia-owners, *HIGH STEAKS* is a call for increased visibility of varied vulvas and a celebration of our vulvas in all their shapes & sizes. See the <a href="https://www.eloina.art/high-steaks-free-sheet" target="_blank">free sheet</a>.         
          
A riotous rebellion against labia-shaming and cosmetic labia surgery, *HIGH STEAKS* is an <a href="https://offies.london/2024-finalists-winners" target="_blank">Offies 2024 Awards Finalist</a>, won a <a href="https://www.summerhall.co.uk/2023/08/2023-lustrum-award-winners-announced" target="_blank">Summerhall 2023 Award</a>, and in <a href="https://theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/21/the-best-theatre-comedy-and-dance-of-2023#theatre" target="_blank">The Guardian's Top 5 Theatre Shows of 2023</a>.         
          
#### Artist        
ELOINA makes work that dismantles taboos around the female body. She mixes epic, body-based performance art and quick, comedy clowning. This makes her work accessibly impactful at both extremes & the in-betweens of the art world.         
         
Since graduating from the innovative Drama degree at Queen Mary University of London in 2018, her solo practice has spread across London — opening conversations about menstruation, body hair, labiaplasty, vaginoplasty, female masturbation & ejaculation, motherhood, and breastfeeding.
