A show about labia, labia-shaming, cosmetic surgery, and fundamentally, body lovin'.<br>Award-winning, queer performer, ELOINA, hangs two beef steaks from her labia, butchers them up, and sizzles them on a grill.<br>And… her mum is in the show.

#### About         
Seamlessly melding performance art and comedy clowning, *HIGH STEAKS* discusses rising demands in young people for labiaplasty — plastic surgery to make the labia smaller/more symmetrical. Through live conversations between ELOINA & her mum and recorded interviews with labia-owners, *HIGH STEAKS* is a call for increased visibility of varied vulvas and a celebration of our vulvas in all their shapes & sizes.

A riotous rebellion against labia-shaming and cosmetic labia surgery, *HIGH STEAKS* has been nominated for three <a href="https://offies.london/2024-finalists-winners" target="_blank">OFFIE 2024 awards</a>, won a <a href="https://www.summerhall.co.uk/2023/08/2023-lustrum-award-winners-announced" target="_blank">Summerhall 2023 Lustrum Award</a>, and is in <a href="https://theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/21/the-best-theatre-comedy-and-dance-of-2023#theatre" target="_blank">The Guardian's Top 5 Theatre Shows of 2023</a>.         
          
#### Artist        
ELOINA makes work that dismantles taboos around the female body. She mixes epic, body-based performance art and quick, comedy clowning. This makes her work accessibly impactful at both extremes and the in-betweens of the art world.         
         
Since graduating from the innovative Drama degree at Queen Mary University of London in 2018, her solo practice has spread across London, opening conversations about menstruation, body hair, labiaplasty, vaginoplasty, female masturbation & ejaculation, motherhood, and breastfeeding.
