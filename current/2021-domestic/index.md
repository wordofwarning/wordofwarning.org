What can you make when your kitchen table is the stage + your camera is the audience? An assembly of artists; a collage of commentary on where we find ourselves now…     
         
#### Artists       
Domestic is an informal online platform for artists to beta test new work, live from their homes — get a feel for it by watching previous events on <a href="http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHmxKLx8cM6BDQVxWcVUAIZapNVroOJWj" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.         
        
Although we sense that artist's appetite for showing their work online from home is *currently* waning, our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling call for proposals remains open</a> — please feel free to suggest something as we'll put together our sixth online event when we've got the right content, potentially later in 2021.

#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so in [2020](/archive/2020-domestic) we began a series of "Domestic at homes" that continued in [January](/current/2021-domestic/january) & [March](/current/2021-domestic/march), with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.         
        
Join us later in 2021 for our sixth set of "artists at home" — selected from our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call for proposals</a>. Real lives, real stories, real homes.          
        
[Domestic](/hab/domestic) online series is hosted by Peader Kirk + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
