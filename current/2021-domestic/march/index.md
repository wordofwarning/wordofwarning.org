#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so we began a series of "Domestic at homes" in [2020](/archive/2020-domestic), with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.         
        
Join us on 10 March for our fifth set of "artists at home" — selected from our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call for proposals</a>. Real lives, real stories, real homes.          
        
#### Programme         
Eleanor May Blackburn · *Wired*<br>&nbsp;"*Wow, I'm having the best time. I'm having the best time. I AM having the best time.*"<br>&nbsp;Eleanor explores the ins and outs of a night out, and how mental health is often an unwanted passenger along for the ride.          
        
Pelican Theatre · *A/Liveness*<br>&nbsp;A glimpse into the private frustrations & fantasies of performers who've lost their audiences…<br>&nbsp;What happens to us when nobody's watching? Are we still Live? Are we still Alive?<br>&nbsp;Created + performed by Pagan Hunt + Ellie Trow<br>&nbsp;Music: *Seeing Abi* by Stephen McKeon        
       
Tom Cassani · *With My Hands*<br>&nbsp;Tom is interested in thinking with his hands.<br>&nbsp;Tom has spent fifteen years with a deck of cards in his palms (or at least nearby).<br>&nbsp;His performance explores this long-standing relationship through both procedural and contemplative text and action.         
        
TomYumSim · *Hotline LIVE*<br>&nbsp;Has lockdown got you down?<br>&nbsp;Are you finding your domestic decisions difficult and droll?<br>&nbsp;Call *Hotline LIVE* and speak to Tommy or Simmy about your domestic dilemmas — put some magic in your mundane and wash away your household woes. (Alternatively, watch calls unfold as *Hotline* pops up on the Domestic live stream.)<br>&nbsp;*Hotline* is proudly queer, DIY in aesthetic, and improvised in nature.<br>&nbsp;Created + performed by Tom Halls + Simone French        
       
Vân Bùi · *Favourite Colours*<br>&nbsp;Music: *Sac Mau* performed by Tran Thu Ha + composed by Tran Tien<br>&nbsp;Special thank you to Resource Productions (@ResourceProds) for providing equipment.
