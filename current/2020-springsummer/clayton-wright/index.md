#### More         
Blending a no-holds-barred interview with his mum, startling performance, moving storytelling, and some good old-fashioned gay porn that his dad bought for him when he was 14 years old — *Sex Education* is a show for anyone who's wondered why they want what they want.          
         
Delivered with the candour, positivity, and charm that have made him an acclaimed international touring success, Harry Clayton-Wright delves into his sexual past live on stage — the good, the bad, and everything in between…           
          
Harry's first solo theatre work, *Sex Education* won the LGBTQ Award at 2017's Brighton Fringe + was nominated for a Total Theatre Award at 2019's Edinburgh Fringe Festival.         
        
#### Who is he?        
Harry Clayton-Wright is an entertainer, performance artist, international mischief-maker + internet provocateur from Blackpool. Growing up in a town ubiquitous with traditional show business (and trashy gay bars) has left stains that simply won't wash out.        
          
Harry's work spans genre and taste levels — dipping his toes into the worlds of entertainment, theatre, film, live art + exhibitionism… His smash hit *Briefs: Close Encounters* sold-out spiegeltents all over the world, culminating in a West End run; his 107-hour immersive installation *The Slumber Party* has been in situ at Glastonbury + the Adelaide Fringe Festival; he starred in Brendan Maclean's <a href="http://vimeo.com/200672866" target="_blank">video for *House Of Air*</a>, racking up over six million views + screening at numerous festivals including SXSW.        
         
Harry has been called a 'Genius' by Cosmopolitan, 'Extraordinary' by The Guardian, 'Absolutely incredible' by BuzzFeed, and a 'Deranged, manic gay bloke' by The Mirror.
