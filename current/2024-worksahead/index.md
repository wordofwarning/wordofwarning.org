Eight very different artists come together to hothouse ideas over the course of one weekend… confessions, tarot, border crossings, pin-pricking, unmade recipes, endurance, space exploration, and horror films will all be in the mix. We invite you to join us on for an informal sharing of this work before the artists embark on a path of shared exploration.

#### About           
Each year since 2012, [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) has invited artists to dig deeper into work presented at [Emergency](/hab/emergency) — usually presenting a show the following May. This year we're doing things a little differently — Works Ahead: Radiator invites a group of artists to an incubator weekend, exploring their own Live Art practice. What may come of it — nobody knows… but join us here on the first step of the journey.         
        
[Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) is a project developed out of the old Method Lab & SeedFund schemes which [hÅb](/hab) ran with greenroom until 2011; to date it has offered over thirty-five small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists.
