**E.M. Parry** · *Pricklings*          
         
*Pricklings* stages the artist's body as trans saint, queer icon, fetish object, witch's poppet, a luck charm, a ritual, a process, a test, a game. The piece investigates trans embodiment and bodily autonomy, and pokes at the edges between self/other, flesh/costume, performer/spectator, artefact/event: remixing and repurposing religious, historical, artistic, medical, and magical iconography to create intimate spectacles and new rituals of becoming.

E.M. is a trans\*-disciplinary artist, designer, and performance-maker, working across scenography, drag, live & visual art, specialising in work which centres queer bodies and narratives. Flitting between genres and platforms, their work has been staged in the West End, international opera stages, pubs, clubs, cabarets, ships, lecture halls, and leaky basements. They work with, through, and for the queer body, squinting at history, flirting with ghosts and the things that go bump in the margins.

**Heather Alice** · *I, The Girl.*         
         
A personal reclamation of the 'hysterical' woman, and a reflection on the paradoxes created when society has gendered madness.<br>A fragmented journey through lived experience and complex representation: contemporary movement practices and transmedia storytelling offer an insight into how medical misogyny shapes our archetypes, and how these depictions in pop culture influence neurodiverse young women.

**Kelvin Atmadibrata** · *untitled*         
         
Kelvin recruits superpowers awakened by puberty and adolescent fantasy, personifying power and strength into fanfiction antiheroes to contest the masculine meta and erotica. He works primarily with performance, often accompanied by and translated into drawings, mixed media collages, and objects compiled as installations. Approached as bricolages, Kelvin translates narratives and recreates personifications based on role-playing video game theories and pop mythologies.
