*Embrace the divine madness of creativity — it takes courage to live with anxiety and vulnerability, but it's what sets creative souls apart.*         
         
A moving exploration of identity and the human experience through visual art & dance. Rooted in the philosophical concepts of existentialism, we are invited to journey through the raw and complex emotions that define us as individuals.         
         
Bringing together the past & the present, the cultural & the new, in a search for belonging and to maintain cultural tradition while adapting to new contexts.          
         
A thought-provoking and evocative celebration of the richness of our identities, offering renewed appreciation for the complexity of what it means to be human.         
        
#### Artist        
Christian, a Black British interdisciplinary artist with Ghanaian roots, resides in the vibrant city of Manchester. With a background in choreography and contemporary dance, his specialisation in Afro-contemporary performance adds a unique flair to his work.        
         
Moreover, Christian is an independent fine artist who creates oil paintings with a particular emphasis on elevating Afrocentric imagery, portraiture, abstraction, and Afrofuturism. His work aims to evoke emotion and showcase the beauty of Black culture through his use of vibrant colours and rich textures.          
       
Christian's multifaceted artistic expressions allow him to captivate audiences through various mediums, and offer an immersive experience that stimulates the senses.         
         
He has collaborated with various organisations, including Black Gold Arts, Contact, Factory International (MIF), and HOME.
