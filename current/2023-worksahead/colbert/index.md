#### Artist        
Kellie is a Greater Manchester-based performance maker. She would describe herself as an autobiographical artist, who creates work that is honest, relatable, and at times self-critical. She uses spoken word & symbolism to explore memories, often focusing on themes of mental health & feminism.         
        
She has collaborated with Eggs Collective, and has been commissioned by NIAMOS and (in)sane Mcr as part of the Starvin Artists project and Breakdown Bolton.
