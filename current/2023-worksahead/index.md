#### Artists        
[Christian Asare · *DUAL*](/current/2023-worksahead/asare)         
         
*Colour is much like music — every hue a note on scale, every tone a pitch that carries… Complimentary and juxtaposed — they yet prevail…*<br>Explores the fluid multiplicity of Black identity through an interdisciplinary diasporic lens — combining visual art, poetry, and Afro-contemporary choreography.         
        
Christian is a Black British interdisciplinary artist with Ghanaian ancestry and heritage. With a background in choreography and contemporary dance, his specialisation in Afro-contemporary performance adds a unique flair to his work. Moreover, he is an independent fine artist who creates oil paintings with a particular emphasis on elevating Afrocentric imagery, portraiture, abstraction, and Afrofuturism.

[Jade Williams · *In Search of Pablo*](/current/2023-worksahead/williams)         
        
*"Black, brilliant, and Manc" — born in 1810, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Fanque" target="_blank">Pablo Fanque</a> was the first Black circus owner in Britain. Come & delight in tales of Pablo's Fantastic Fair as I channel his story to explore my own journey to being Black, brilliant, & Manc.*<br>An exploration of belonging and Black identity in the diaspora.         
        
Jade is a Black, Queer, multi-disciplinary artist and experienced teacher from Manchester working in dance, poetry, writing, performance, and creative facilitation.

[Kellie Colbert · *Dedicated To The One I Love* ](/current/2023-worksahead/colbert)         
         
*And tell all the stars above. This is dedicated to the one I love.<br>(Love can never be exactly like we want it to be.)*<br>An exploration of love, betrayal, and care.        
        
Kellie is a Greater Manchester-based performance maker. She would describe herself as an autobiographical artist, who creates work that is honest, relatable, and at times self-critical. Kellie uses spoken word and symbolism to explore memories, often focusing on themes of mental health and feminism. She aims to create performance that is both self-exposing and empathetic.
