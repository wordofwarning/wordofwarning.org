*"Black, brilliant, and Manc" — born in 1810, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Fanque" target="_blank">Pablo Fanque</a> was the first Black circus owner in Britain. Come & delight in tales of Pablo's Fantastic Fair as I channel his story to explore my own journey to being Black, brilliant, & Manc.*          
         
An exploration of belonging and Black identity in the diaspora. Jade responds to the question "No, where are you really from?" and unapologetically provides you with the answer. So, roll up to the fair and enjoy the show…        
         
#### Artist        
Jade is a Black, Queer, multi-disciplinary artist and experienced teacher from Manchester working in dance, poetry, writing, performance, and creative facilitation. She has worked closely with Community Arts North West, Curious Minds, and DIY Theatre on projects for young people in Greater Manchester.         
         
You are most likely to find her dancing in the streets of Manchester with her headphones on, connecting with her mind, body, and soul. Jade created *Dance or Die* to challenge herself and others to respond to music instinctively and connect with their inner creative spirit.         
         
Jade has previously been commissioned by Blaze Arts and Oldham Coliseum to explore forgotten Black British figures and honour their memory.<br>She particularly celebrated Pablo Fanque and reignited his famous circus through the forms of movement, poetry, and spoken word performance.
