**Bingo Meg + Disco Jazz ¦ *Carboot Disco Bingo***        
An interactive experience — part dance-lesson, part party, part performance, part bingo. Essentially it's an elaborate game of bingo combined with the magic of disco, think Henry Ford meets Donna Summer down the gala! C'mon disco dogs, get your groove on!        
        
Megan Clark-Bagnall + Jasmine Loveys are Bristol-based independent artists, establishing *Carboot Disco Bingo* for Punchbowl Festival in 2012 — it has since toured the UK performing at festivals, art centres and Danny Boyle’s Shuffle Film Festival; in June 2013 they created and delivered several craft stations and *Carboot Disco Bingo* workshops for The Royal Shakespeare Company during their summer family festival. Jasmine makes solo performance, happenings, and interactive experiences; Megan likes making sculptural objects, installations, immersive art forms and live art.
