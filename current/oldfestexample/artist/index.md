*Two women search for content. Meaning and substance is sourced through the philosophical medium of burlesque. Two women perform.*            

70/30 Split is Sophie Unwin and Lydia Cottrell, two York based choreographersÂ and performers. Together they present an accumulation of words, thoughts, characters, expectations, stories, experiences and alternatives. Creating satirically energetic dance theatre work, the pair utilise movement, text, honesty and leotards, combining burlesque, bodies and the bizarre. They have performed to audiences both nationally and throughout the region including Leeds Light Night, Friday Firsts at Yorkshire Dance, Heads up north east at Edinburgh Fringe and Spring Loaded at The Place, London.
