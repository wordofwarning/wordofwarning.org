*And tell all the stars above. This is dedicated to the one I love.<br>(Love can never be exactly like we want it to be.)*          
         
An exploration of love, betrayal, and care — an autobiographical performance that aims to create a safe space as Kellie confronts the fears of being alone, longing for an artificial connection to transfer her to reality.        

*Dedicated To The One I Love* is an exposing and relatable performance that challenges and defies the suffocating truth we sometimes refuse to believe.       
         
#### Artist        
Kellie is a Greater Manchester-based performance maker. She would describe herself as an autobiographical artist, who creates work that is honest, relatable, and at times self-critical. Kellie uses spoken word and symbolism to explore memories, often focusing on themes of mental health and feminism. She aims to create performance that is both self-exposing and empathetic.         
        
Kellie has collaborated with Eggs Collective, and has been commissioned by NIAMOS & (in)sane Mcr as part of the Starvin Artists project, and by Breakdown Bolton to create short performance videos to raise mental health awareness.        
         
Her biggest accomplishment to date is publicly debuting *Root*, an intimate performance video that explores & exposes trichotillomania — it went on to be supported by HabitAware, a company who aims to raise awareness for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours.
