*Presented by* Word of Warning + Contact<br>***NB* this performance is sold-out.**                  
         
*And tell all the stars above. This is dedicated to the one I love.*         
         
An exploration of anxiety, love, deception, and survival.<br>(Love can never be exactly like we want it to be.)         
         
How do we give care and how can we tell if somebody really cares for us?         
         
*Dedicated To The One I Love* draws on Kellie's real experience of being gaslit — a performance that aims to create a safe space as Kellie confronts the fears of being alone, and falls for an artificial connection. All she wants now is a transfer to reality because the truth is, *you don't own me*.         
         
An exposing and relatable performance that challenges and defies suffocating truths we sometimes struggle to believe.

#### Artist        
Kellie is a Greater Manchester-based performance maker. She would describe herself as an autobiographical artist, who creates work that is honest, relatable, and at times self-critical. Kellie uses spoken word and symbolism to explore memories, often focusing on themes of mental health and feminism. She aims to create performance that is both self-exposing and empathetic.         
        
Kellie has collaborated with Eggs Collective, and has been commissioned by NIAMOS & (in)sane Mcr as part of the *Starvin Artists* project and by Breakdown Bolton to create short performance videos to raise mental health awareness. She is currently part of the co-curation group at Factory International, organising an event for early 2025.        
         
Her biggest accomplishment to date is publicly debuting *Root*, an intimate performance video that explores and exposes trichotillomania — it went on to be supported by HabitAware, a company who aims to raise awareness for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours.
