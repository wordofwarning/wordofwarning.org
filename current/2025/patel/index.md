A movement ritual of care and resilience — to nurture our connections to the elders and ancestors.          

*How has colonialism impacted the care we have received from our elders?<br>How did we experience their resilience?<br>What nurturing strategies can we share with each other to help us thrive, in a mainstream society that seeks to racialise and dehumanise us?<br>Can we create rituals and spaces to care for ourselves?*
