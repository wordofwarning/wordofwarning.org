A movement ritual of care and resilience — to nurture our connections to the elders and ancestors.          

*How has colonialism impacted the care we have received from our elders?<br>How did we experience their resilience?<br>What nurturing strategies can we share with each other to help us thrive, in a mainstream society that seeks to racialise and dehumanise us?<br>Can we create rituals and spaces to care for ourselves?*         
         
Women from the Global Ethnic Majority — whose families have been impacted by colonisation — share their own histories of care, resilience, legacy, and how these stories live in their bodies. Going beyond everyday storytelling, they transform those energies into a live experience.

This performance draws upon a phase of R&D that focused on weaving personal storytelling, movement, dramaturgy, and community. (A work in progress was shown on 23 April at <a href="https://unitytheatreliverpool.co.uk/whats-on/were-here-because-they-were" target="_blank">Unity Theatre Liverpool</a>.)
