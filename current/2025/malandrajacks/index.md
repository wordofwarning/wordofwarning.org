*Presented by* Word of Warning + HOME         
         
This is what happens when a working-class community tells its own story…        
         
A bus ride. A bingo card. A memory you didn’t know you shared.         
         
*This is our neighbourhood, not the one in the media, but the one shaped by our stories, our laughter, and our silence.*         
         
Award-winning duo Malandra Jacks invite you into a world of spellbinding projection, real voices, and unapologetic heart. Part theatre, part time capsule; a celebration of communities rarely seen on stage.         
         
Funny, intimate, and defiant — *Census* is a love letter to working-class communities, and a call to remember who we are and what we carry with us.
