#### About         
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy, and to also introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond, including online…          
>*If you haven't attended one of these performance evenings yet, <a href="https://thelowry.com/wtf-wednesday-m2wx" target="_blank">WTF</a> are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that's out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews (Nov 2019)</a> on <a href="https://thelowry.com/wtf-wednesday-m2wx" target="_blank">WTF Wednesdays with Lowry</a>         
      
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. Over the past thirteen or so years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Action Hero, Avital Raz, Chanje Kunda, Cheryl Martin, Darren Pritchard, Deborah Pearson, ELOINA, FK Alexander, Harry Clayton-Wright, Hetain Patel, Jo Bannon, Kim Noble, Michael Pinchbeck, Proto-type Theater, Richard DeDomenici, Ron Athey, WilL Dickie, Stacy Makishi, Two Destination Language, and Uncurbed Collective (amongst others).

#### Audiences         
We don't want to put you off by talking art form labels — yes, there'll be theatre, Live Art, performance, dance, etc. — as our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So, if you like comedy, music, gaming, or want a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on…         
>*Astonishing. Like nothing else. Transformative, immersive, moving.*<br>*Always special, bringing the unexpected and intriguing, thank you.*<br>*Fabulous for seeing things different from the mainstream machine.<br>Really important and interesting work, different to everything else.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience feedback

#### People        
Tamsin Drury, [hÅb](/hab)'s Director, has been around a while — a really long while — she's been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape, and firing a glitter-cannon to the *Hallelujah* chorus! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has worked with hundreds of GM & NW artists to help them create new work.<br><i>Please send programming enquiries to her via <mailto:info@habmcr.org></i>
