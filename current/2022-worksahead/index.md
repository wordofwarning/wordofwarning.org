2022's sample of new work-in-development picks up where we were so rudely interrupted in 2020 — showing the now-finished live version of **Will Dickie**'s *White Sun* alongside a re-imagined development of **Ross McCaffrey**'s *Sometimes History Needs A Push*.        
        
In 2021 we also commissioned Helena Ascough and Jade Williams — we now present the digital outcome of **Helena Ascough**'s *What A Clown!*, with Jade's work coming to fruition in 2023.
