This year's sample of new work-in-development picks up where we were interrupted in [2020](/hab/worksahead/#2020) — showing the now-finished live version of **Will Dickie**'s *White Sun* alongside a re-imagined development of **Ross McCaffrey**'s *Sometimes History Needs A Push*.        
        
We also commissioned Helena Ascough and Jade Williams in [2021](/hab/worksahead/#2021) — and now present the digital outcome of **Helena Ascough**'s *What A Clown!*, with Jade Williams' work coming to fruition in 2023.        
        
Get a feel for Works Ahead with a look at our last full edition in [2019](/archive/2019-worksahead).
