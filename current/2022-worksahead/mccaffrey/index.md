*Presented by* Word of Warning + Contact *in* [Works Ahead 2022](/current/2022-worksahead)        
        
This is a story about the power of the state. A story about the power of ordinary people. A story about hope. And it's all made up.         
        
In a country not unlike this one, society feels like it's breaking down. After what seems like a series of unprecedented, catastrophic events, three people take matters into their own hands — and make plans for revolution.        
        
If people seized political power for themselves, what would they do with it?        
        
An interactive work-in-progress about how we make sense of the world — with remote-controlled cars, house parties, and a chaotic courtroom.
