#### About        
This is a story about the power of the state. A story about the power of ordinary people. A story about hope. And it's all made up.         
        
In a country not unlike this one, society feels like it's breaking down. After what seems like a series of unprecedented, catastrophic events, three people take matters into their own hands — and make plans for revolution.        
        
An interactive work-in-progress about how we make sense of the world — with remote-controlled cars, house parties, and a chaotic courtroom — that asks "if people seized political power for themselves, what would they do with it?"        
        
#### Artist        
A Manchester-based theatre-maker + musician, Ross makes work that centres around people, power, and what makes us tick. A founding member of theatre company Powder Keg (winners of the Hodgkiss Award 2016), he has toured nationally + internationally with The Javaad Alipoor Company, and is a CYC alumnus. Past collaborations include Gob Squad, Daniel Bye, Stacy Makishi.
