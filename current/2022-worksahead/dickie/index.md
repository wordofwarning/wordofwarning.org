*Presented by* Word of Warning + Contact *in* [Works Ahead 2022](/current/2022-worksahead)        
        
A lo-fi solo symphony of words and movement.         
           
Conjuring the ghosts of the men who have dominated the stage before him, Will takes us on a journey — navigating the tensions of inheritance, privilege, and addiction.        
        
*Personal and political. Unsettling and humorous.<br>What do you see when you look at Will?<br>A white son.<br>A boy who can’t stop moving.<br>Can't stop speaking.<br>And pointing.<br>Pointing at old actors and being successful.<br>Pointing at sugar and the milky bar kid.<br>Pointing at the sun.*        
        
Set against a backdrop of a nation that continues to bask in the light of its colonial legacy, hooked on profits despite the costs. *White Sun* collides with the past in the here and now of a human nervous system.         
         
#### Artist        
A Liverpool-based performance maker, Will works across several artforms which support liveness including theatre, dance, live art, sound, and film. He makes material by listening and responding to spaces — spaces in the environment, spaces within the body, and spaces from his past. He creates experiences for audiences from these spaces using choreography, spoken text, audience participation, and sound design/DJing.        
          
His previous live touring works include *[The Rave Space](/archive/2019-springsummer/dickie)*, *Team of the Decades*, and *Memories of Suburbia*. His recent dance film *Canning Town*, created with Fabiola Santana, has been screened internationally — winning best film awards in Bucharest, Lisbon, and Glasgow. Listen to his DJ mix series *The Wayz* at https://www.mixcloud.com/AlwaysWill

#### Reviews         
>*Hugely engaged, moved and actually (and lingeringly) harrowed by it… Bit by bit, the strands come together in a meaningful confrontation with how the past still haunts and shapes our present existence, our moral compass and our sense of who we are.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience Feedback
