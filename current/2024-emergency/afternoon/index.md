**Billy Gigurtsis** · *Curved Lines*         
          
A durational, interdisciplinary, installation piece utilising stillness & spoken word. *Curved Lines* invites you to examine the architecture of deformity, and the systems that so contain it.

**Diane Dwyer** · *Diane the American Swimmer Says, "Don't Worry!"*         
          
A recurring persona project: a ridiculous character who thinks she can do anything, cause she's American. Her motto is: *"DON’T WORRY!"*         
          
Diane Dwyer is a Brooklyn (USA)-based interdisciplinary artist with a focus on performance. Recent performances include Performance Art Open (Bergen, Norway) and The Ivory Tower & the Open Worlds (Brooklyn, NY, USA).

**Emergency Chorus** · *Reading and Writing*         
         
Reading too much into a simple phrase, two performers turn a few select words into a strange game of sense & nonsense. Is this a business pitch? A therapy session? An activists’ meeting?<br>*Reading and Writing* is an improvised performance in which text becomes music, and meaning is all in the mind.         
         
Emergency Chorus is Ben Kulvichit (he/him) & Clara Potter-Sweet (they/she). Bristol-based, they make performances which straddle experimental theatre, Live Art, dance — often colliding disparate source materials to create collages of text, choreography, music, image. Recently they've created a dance piece which predicts the future, a choir of town criers, a scratch night for 'old' work.

**Farida Yesmin** · *Blissful Sorrow (part II)*         
         
A poetic durational performance exploring personal experience of chronic pain, displacement, and the endurance of prejudices as a woman who faced modern slavery.<br>Born in Bangladesh & having migrated to the UK about 20 years ago, the artist traces her journey of self-discovery & healing by grappling with her Bangladeshi heritage, cultural expectations, and the (metaphorical & physical) wounds that she carries in her body.<br>The performance further explores Farida's powerlessness in relation to the current political upheaval and the violence that her family & many others are currently experiencing in Bangladesh, with the rise of Islamic extremism.         
         
In her ever-evolving artistic practice, Farida Yesmin (f.k.a. Kajoli Ilojak) experiments with different media (from photography & drawing to live performance) to explore issues of gender, body politics, and cross-cultural identity through a feminist lens. She engages with the cultural expectations & ideological restrictions she confronts as a woman, as an artist, and as a refugee. She negotiates language barriers while staging her 'otherness' using her body, voice, painting, and gestural mark-making as means of communication.

**Heather Alice White** · *No Caller ID*         
         
*Entering a solitary tournament on which her life depends. Deciphering willpower, genetics, and chance. Asking the questions she doesn't want to know the answers to. Where is that call coming from? Is the realisation too late or was it futile from the start? No physical challenge, only mental strength — play the game.*<br>A durational Live Art performance exploring hereditary addiction & cyclical futility.         
         
Thank you to Peader Kirk for inciting this work at Works Ahead: Radiator.

**Jennifer Ng** · *Same Moon But Different Suns*         
          
*Every day, I live my time thrice — now, in the past, and in the future.*<br>A durational performance by Jennifer Ng, as a response to a dislocated form of floating existence.         
         
Dr Jennifer Ng is a Singaporean-born interdisciplinary artist who lives & practises art in the UK. Concepts in her work emerge through material experimentations & spatial immersion. She uses embodiment aesthetics, and practice trajectories stemming from her eclectic cultural experiences to investigate themes of 'existence/absence', 'loss/lost', 'distance/displacement'.

**Ludo & Jake** · *I.D.S.T.*         
         
*A detail that is not poetic. It isn't about pretending. Every word I say is a promise. Why did you come here?*         
A symbiotic relationship revealed in an extra-ordinary liminal space that behaves as a playground for adults. Two performers co-exist here through games, rules, strategies, and numbers that unlock action & storytelling — coming from the true lives & memories of its inhabitants.          
*We don't speak about a memory as if it were something that could be changed. If Destroyed Still True.*          
           
Created & performed by Jake Walton & Ludovica Tagariello.

**Martin Hamblen** · *iCriedWolves*         
         
*Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Can you hear me?*<br>A literal interpretation of a familiar fable: A boy cried wolf.<br>This fable reflects & resonates with our contemporary circumstances. Performing it, post-pandemic, during a cost-of-living crisis, through man-made climate change, while sifting fake news from facts, seems pertinent. Reciting a single word over & over (in multiple languages) aims to politely provoke a passing audience to consider a question: *Do we share the same wolves?*         
         
Martin Hamblen's practice is an antisyzygy — a union of opposites — that includes collecting multiples (nine) of the same thing and performing phrases, literal interpretations of language. Before studying Fine Art, he studied Psychology. His work has been funded by both Arts Council England & Creative Scotland. He lives in SW Scotland.

**Nicola Dale** · *Director*         
          
Working in the crevice between performance & sculpture, Nicola Dale asks what it is to be an object, or be treated as one.<br>Through this focus on 'objecthood', she thinks about how we occupy space & how often we are merely a vessel for someone else’s story, a guest in someone else's space, beholden to someone else's (unspoken) criteria.<br>Exploring objecthood provides an opportunity to take some power back — and offer it to others. An object that can be held, worn, or entered into is a sign that space can be opened up, rather than dominated.          
         
Nicola Dale is a Stockport-based visual artist. She has undertaken extensive exhibitions, commissions, residencies, and performances in the UK & internationally. She has recently shown with the Aesthetica Art Prize (longlist), Saatchi Gallery & Bobinska Brownlee (London), Pabst Gallery (Florida), The Hepworth Wakefield, The Grundy (Blackpool).

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz          
         
Riley Hamshaw-Mills is a Lowestoft-based working-class artist involved in producing experimental work from all different aspects of performance, including Live Art, immersive/site specific, and autobiographical theatre. His work looks to blend the mundane aspects of living with surreal ideas & feelings, with satire and small town working-class attitudes being a through point in a lot of his work.

**Robyn Greeves** · *the sin of being*         
         
*It'll always be there, pulling at you. But you should know that it's damned.<br>By the sons & daughters it'll produce. By the lovers who will depend on it. By your doctors & employers. By the creator of the universe.<br>You are woven into the sin itself. If it were anyone else, it'd be called divine madness.<br>But it's not him, it's you. And it's your cross to bear.<br>Smile! Repent & cleanse yourself. Your purity will be your life force, and your condemnation is the most natural thing in the world.<br>You're a woman now. Happy 12th birthday.*<br>Exploring secrecy & shame around fertility & sexuality, how it manifests in the body, and how to reclaim what can't be purified.         
         
Robyn Greeves is a contemporary performance artist, physical performer, and textile artist with a focus on creating postmodern performance work to explore & deconstruct politics & human behaviour.

**Rowena Gander** · *Bed Death*         
         
Exploring the 'death' of an intimate relationship, throughout the durational work, the lesbian performance artist, Rowena Gander, aggressively destroys a bed to signify the emotions one might experience when two people in a relationship are no longer compatible. The audience are invited to join the artist in bed to briefly share their experiences of their incompatible relationships.         
          
Dr Rowena Gander is an academic / international performance artist who creates thought-provoking solo performance works that question & negotiate themes of sexuality, power, and objectification in women. Rowena has relentlessly pursued themes of lesbian sexuality in her physical performance work and has created an acclaimed body of work that is powerful, empowering, challenging, and at times, uncomfortable.

**The Paula Davy** · *I Scream*         
         
*On entering the water, resist the urge to swim until the cold(shock) has passed.*<br>You are invited to visit Paula The Disappointment at her traditional Ice Cream Cart and exchange your inner most hopes & fears for something more useful.         
         
Paula Davy is a solo live artist from a background of political activism & protest. Influenced by personal histories, biography, her own feelings of displacement, and strained family relationships, her practice could be described as Live Art happenings. Most of her works are informed by a biographical trilogy — *Paula The Slut*, *Paula The Disappointment*, *Paula The Depressive* — each celebrating a negative aspect of her history.
