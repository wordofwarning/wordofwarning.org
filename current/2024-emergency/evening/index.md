A man lives & dies for his work on the ninth floor.<br>Exploring two worlds — the story of the man upstairs and the memories of a child on a beach — the performer creates a live soundscape and tells a tale that tries to untangle the grief & pain of letting your childhood dreams die to go & work in concrete buildings.<br>Inspired by John Hartford's 1971 song *In Tall Buildings*, *Mortar* is a show for everyone — the everyday worker — you, me, and the man upstairs.         
         
Special thanks to Manchester School of Theatre at MMU.

**Drunken Chorus** · *GREATEST HITS*         
         
A collection of mis-remembered, botched, and wildly confused moments from an 'illustrious' performance career.<br>*As the hits are introduced, excitement builds. The two performers begin rifling through real & imagined memories. There is a dance — a big musical number. (Or at least there's meant to be). They put on animal masks, switch on the smoke machine, and do a few high kicks. The 'Hits' are coming thick & fast…<br>But this glitzy compilation of 'best bits' soon loses its way. Cracks begin to open up, and the performers struggle to conceal what's lurking in the wings. As the smoke clears, the familiar shadows of anxiety, burnout, failure, and grief set their sights on centre stage.*         
         
Devised & performed by Chris Williams & Sheena Holliday.         
         
Drunken Chorus was formed in the NW in the late 2000's, to make & tour live performance. Their work has since evolved & developed to include running artist support programmes, live events like *DRUNKEN NIGHTS*, and major arts festivals including the Mayor of London's *Liberty Festival*. Because of this, they haven't made work of their own in a very long time; *GREATEST HITS* will be their first new performance in over seven years.

**Isabella Victorie A.** · *fragments.foyc*         
         
A performance art piece about emotional abuse that has been created in order to raise awareness. It depicts fragments of the vortex survivors find themselves stuck in, in all its painful reality.<br>The performer is on a mission to raise awareness of emotional abuse, so that prevention can eventually be achieved. Emotional abuse is as harmful as physical abuse. It leads to isolation, a variety of illnesses, and can even lead to death… *It's time we talk about it!*

**Jana Aizupe & Company** · *if I stay here any longer I will stay here forever*         
         
That feeling when you keep making coffee thinking "*okay, I will make coffee & then I will start*", "*okay, I will go for a walk & then I will start*". The start turns into staring onto a blank page. Getting up. Making another coffee…<br>An experimental performance piece with live music about the inability to begin.

**Kelvin Atmadibrata** · *but nothing happened!*         
         
*Like a carp climbing up a waterfall to become a dragon…*<br>This ode to growing old, to ageing, to maturity, and perhaps to adulting, starts life clean, new, and pristine — but slowly turns muddy-gold through touring repetition, documenting the journey of the work, and placing importance on the body as a vessel & breathing mannequin.<br>An homage to Nintendo's 1996-ongoing series of video game, Pokemon's infamous *Magikarp*, the work borrows its signature (and caricature) move 'Splash' as its main point of reference.          
          
Kelvin Atmadibrata recruits superpowers awakened by puberty & adolescent fantasy, personifying power & strength into fanfiction antiheroes to contest the masculine meta & erotica.

**Lewys Holt** · *Twenty Minute Set*         
         
Fusing dance, stand-up, theatre, and song into twenty minutes of discussions, demonstrations, and dances about such subjects as: the passing of time, guilt, Duracell bunnies, bus timetables, existential philosophy.<br>Often humorous & profound, these heavily practised, yet unplanned & unscripted, performances are thrilling experiences of shared risk between the performer & the audience which are not to be missed.

**Ludo & Jake** · *I.D.S.T.*         
         
*A detail that is not poetic. It isn't about pretending. Every word I say is a promise. Why did you come here?*<br>A symbiotic relationship revealed in an extra-ordinary liminal space that behaves as a playground for adults. Two performers co-exist here through games, rules, strategies, and numbers that unlock action & storytelling — coming from the true lives & memories of its inhabitants.<br>*We don't speak about a memory as if it were something that could be changed. If Destroyed Still True.*
