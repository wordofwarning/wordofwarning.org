**Heather Alice** · *I, The Girl.*         
         
A personal reclamation of the 'hysterical' woman, and a reflection on the paradoxes created when society has gendered madness.<br>A fragmented journey through lived experience and complex representation: contemporary movement practices and transmedia storytelling offer an insight into how medical misogyny shapes our archetypes, and how these depictions in pop culture influence neurodiverse young women.         
         
Thanks to director Joshua Allen. · Videography by Chloe Holford & Joshua Allen.

**Jana Aizupe & Company** · *get me out of here*         
         
Two crisp packet beings trying to get past the line to complete the task and escape the space. There is a time pressure and they are not allowed to make any noise. This proves to be seemingly impossible, as crisps churn with every move they make. Will they do it in time?<br>There is optional audience participation, allowing you to give advice and help the beings achieve the success they crave.         
         
Created in collaboration with Gi Vasey, Caroline O'Mahoney, Dara Hughes.         
         
Jana Aizupe is a working-class theatre artist based in the West Midlands, primarily working through devising, movement, and film. She is a trained street dancer, therefore values non-verbal connections through shared movements in space. She is also very passionate about applied theatre, putting emphasis on the process of co-creation. Her devised work *1001* won the Warwick University Research Prize 2021, and was performed at Omnibus Theatre and Camden People's Theatre SPRINT Festival in 2022.
