**lili Spain | Break on Through (to the Other Side)**                
Pillaging elements of ancient ritual, anthropology, psychoanalysis and self-hypnosis, the work is an attempt to break through/back to an alternate state/time, and one of a series of performances marking the centenary of the publication of Sigmund Freud's controversial *Totem and Taboo* (2013).

lili Spain is an artist living and working in London. Starting from a sculptural sensibility her artwork encompasses a diverse range of media, including installation, film and performance. She uses found objects and shards of text to develop imagined, mythical histories that are obsessively reworked to form hybrid art pieces, often manifesting as performance relics or detrital remnants. The resulting works are often both unsettling and absurd. She draws reference from mythology, theology, personal history and psychoanalysis.            
               
lili has performed and exhibited at a variety of prestigious venues, including the Whitechapel Art Gallery, Milton Keynes Gallery and De La Warr Pavilion. She is currently working on a series of performances marking the centenary of the publication of Sigmund Freud's controversial *Totem and Taboo* (2013), in Egypt and the UK. She curated the hugely successful Totemic Festival of performance inspired by the text, which took place at the Freud Museum London 5-7 July 2013.

**Maiada aBOUD | The Eucharist**             
*"Working in performance while reflecting on my personal background as an Arab Israeli Christian female artist was really appropriate for looking into the gaps, conflicts and limitations of the intercultural dialogue (especially after moving to the UK). Furthermore it helped me to explore the cultural differences, political commitment and political identity.*          
              
*"As a woman living in a patriarchal society and as an Arab citizen living in a Jewish country, I have used my body in performance art as an actual material to reflect the social and the emotional conflict, trying to break down barriers between art and life.*          
            
*"In my work I have always tried to employ forms of resistance to the sexual and social roles that I play as a woman; the role that I have had to follow throughout my life as a way of transcending the 'unkindness' of the real circumstances, finding my identity as an artist. In my society men are meant to control everyday life as part of the patriarchal society. These reasons and many more brought me to deal with the issues of identity, gender and sexuality so as to accomplish the things that are forbidden in my family, society, and religion."*

**Kerry Carroll | All imperfect things**               
Inspired by the 1993 film *The Piano*, this partly autobiographical work is about expression; using the body to speak, to portray your desires.            
                      
*"I will sometimes see an image or hear music, even read something that I find striking or inspiring, something that feeds my creativity; and then I take that and perform it, express it any way I can. I film these 'bursts' of performances and keep them. These small bursts might only be 20 seconds long, but over a period of time these bursts grow into a full-length piece.*                
               
*"With this particular piece I drew upon a film that I have always admired, for its simplicity and its dark romantic beauty. The imagery and the music gave me so much inspiration; I'd always wanted to test the waters and perform it on stage. I had a great amount of material from my 'bursts' that married with the material I had created from the film, so I chose to make it my first solo piece of work. It's something I have wanted to work on for a long while and it's an exciting feeling to perform something that is so different from anything I've done before."*

**Beth J Ross | Kleines Haus ii**                  
*Kleines Haus ii* is a quiet installation where the viewer becomes the participant, and the piece. It deals with personal spaces, intimacy, our relationship to others, and asks what 'home' is.                
                            
*"Interested in the ideas of family, memory, home and history; my work to date includes installation, photography, sculpture and drawing. Following a career as a teacher, the birth of my two children proved a catalyst to my work and I started studying fine art in 2011."*
